1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,200
The perfect launch.

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
And a controlled drop.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,600
This is as good a descent
as it's possible to make.

4
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,760
Its parents are there to meet it.

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,480
A little dazed perhaps,
but all in one piece.

6
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,360
One gosling, at least, hasn't made it.

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
And this chick appears to be in a bad way.

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
At last, it responds
to its mother's calls.

9
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,440
The resilience of a barnacle goose chick
is extraordinary.

10
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,240
But there are still chicks
unaccounted for,

11
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,440
somewhere amongst the rubble.

12
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,280
The parents can't risk searching
because they need to lead

13
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,320
their two survivors away quickly,
before predators arrive.

14
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
A third one has made it.

15
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,720
But it needs to catch up.

16
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Reunited.

17
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,720
Three out of five chicks have made it.

18
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,760
Without such a dramatic start in life,

19
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,280
it's unlikely any of them
would have even got this far.
