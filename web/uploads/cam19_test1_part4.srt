00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:08,560
For my presentation today, I'm going to talk about the Ceide Fields in the northwest of Ireland,

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,720
one of the largest Neolithic sites in the world.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,960
I recently visited this site

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,820
and observed the work that is currently being done by a team of archaeologists there.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,500
The site was first discovered in the 1930s

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,660
by a local teacher, Patrick Caulfield.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,720
He noticed that when local people were digging in the bog,

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,540
they were constantly hitting against what seemed to be rows of stones.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,160
He realised that these must be walls

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:45,240
and that they must be thousands of years old for them to predate the bog which subsequently grew over them.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,880
He wrote to the National Museum in Dublin to ask them to investigate,

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,880
but no one took him seriously.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,480
It wasn't until 40 years later,

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,000
when Patrick Caulfield's son Seamus, who had become an archaeologist by then, began to explore further.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,320
He inserted iron probes into the bog to map the formation of the stones,

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,560
a traditional method which local people had always used for finding fuel buried in the bog for thousands of years.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,700
Carbon dating later proved that the site was over 5,000 years old

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,460
and was the largest Neolithic site in Ireland.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,080
Thanks to the bog which covers the area,

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,580
the remains of the settlement at Ceide Fields, which is over 5,000 years old,

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,340
are extremely well-preserved.

22
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,280
A bog is 90% water

23
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,840
its soil is so saturated that when the grasses and heathers that grow on its surface die,

24
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,120
they don't fully decay but accumulate in layers.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,400
Objects remain so well preserved in these conditions

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,720
because of the acidity of the peat and the deficiency of oxygen.

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,000
At least 175 days of rain a year are required for this to happen

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,400
this part of Ireland gets an average of 225 days.

29
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,340
The Neolithic farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed several centuries of relative peace and stability.

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,420
Neolithic farmers generally lived in larger communities than their predecessors,

31
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,320
with a number of houses built around a community building.

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,300
As they lived in permanent settlements,

33
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,120
Neolithic farmers were able to build bigger houses.

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,980
These weren't round as people often assume,

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,040
but rectangular with a small hole in the roof that allowed smoke to escape.

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,800
This is one of many innovations

37
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,340
and indicates that the Neolithic farmers were the first people to cook indoors.

38
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,740
Another new technology that Neolithic settlers brought to Ireland was pottery.

39
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,480
Fragments of Neolithic pots have been found in Ceide and elsewhere in Ireland.

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,900
The pots were used for many things

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,200
as well as for storing food,

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,360
pots were filled with a small amount of fat

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,240
and when this was set alight, they served as lamps.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,040
It's thought that the Ceide Fields were mainly used as paddocks for animals to graze in.

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:29,180
Evidence from the Ceide Fields suggests that each plot of land was of a suitable size to sustain an extended family.

46
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,760
They may have used a system of rotational grazing

47
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,060
in order to prevent over-grazing

48
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,860
and to allow for plant recovery and regrowth.

49
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,400
This must've been a year-round activity

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,360
as no structures have been found which would have been used to shelter animals in the winter.

51
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,840
However, archaeologists believe that this way of life at Ceide ceased abruptly.

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,500
Why was this?

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,300
Well, several factors may have contributed to the changing circumstances.

54
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,420
The soil would have become less productive and led to the abandonment of farming.

55
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,680
The crop rotation system was partly responsible for this

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,480
as it would have been very intensive and was not sustainable.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,500
But there were also climatic pressures too.

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,700
The farmers at Ceide would have enjoyed a relatively dry period,

59
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,620
but this began to change

60
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,740
and the conditions became wetter as there was a lot more rain.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,660
It was these conditions that encouraged the bog to form over the area which survives today.

62
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,400
So now I'd like to show you...
