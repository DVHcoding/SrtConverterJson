00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:12,246
Baking apple pie?
Discount orange warehouse has you covered!

2
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:14,163
A fruit’s a fruit, right?

3
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:18,621
It’s 1988, and scientist James Hansen 
has just testified

4
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,663
to the United States Congress 
that global warming trends

5
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:23,704
are caused by human activity,

6
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:27,621
and will pose an increasing threat 
to humanity in the future.

7
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:33,079
Well, well. 
That’s unusually prescient for a human.

8
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:37,287
Looking for a wedding dress?
Try a new take on a timeless classic.

9
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:41,829
It’s sleek, flattering and modest— 
just like the traditional dress.

10
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:46,787
Commercials.
Could anything be more insufferable?

11
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,787
It’s 1997, and the United States Senate 
has called a hearing about global warming.

12
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,579
Some expert witnesses point out that 
past periods in Earth’s history

13
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:58,829
were warmer than the 20th century.

14
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,537
Because such variations
existed long before humans,

15
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,953
the witnesses claim the current
warming trend

16
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:08,079
is also the result of natural variation.

17
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:13,204
Ah, there is something more insufferable
than a commercial.

18
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:17,746
Luckily for the humans, 
there’s one more expert witness.

19
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:28,913
What are you looking at? 
We’re all dressed.

20
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:32,121
At least we are by the logic 
you just used.

21
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:36,121
It’s as if you were to say 
apples and oranges are both fruits,

22
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,204
therefore they taste the same.

23
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:42,121
Or that underwear, wedding dresses, 
and suits are all clothes,

24
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:46,204
therefore, they’re all equally appropriate
attire for a Senate hearing.

25
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:54,913
The European wars of the 19th century 
and World War I were all wars, right?

26
00:01:56,371 --> 00:02:01,704
So World War I couldn’t be any more
devastating than those other wars,

27
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,788
could it?

28
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:06,746
Let’s say two people have a fever.

29
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:10,496
They must have the same disease 
that’s causing that fever, right?

30
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:17,746
Of course not. 
One fever could be caused by chicken pox,

31
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:21,871
the other by influenza, 
or any number of other infections.

32
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,954
Like your claim about rising
global temperatures,

33
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:30,913
these claims make a false analogy.

34
00:02:30,954 --> 00:02:35,163
You're assuming that because two phenomena
share a characteristic,

35
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:39,829
in this case warming, 
they are analogous in other ways,

36
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,329
like the cause of that warming.

37
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,704
But there’s no evidence 
that that’s the case.

38
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:48,913
Yes, there have been other warm periods 
in Earth’s history—

39
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:52,038
no one’s disputing that the climate 
fluctuates.

40
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:56,954
But let's take a closer look at some of
those older examples of global warming,

41
00:02:56,954 --> 00:02:57,996
shall we?

42
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:02,913
The Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse,
92 million years ago,

43
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:06,038
was so warm, 
forests covered Antarctica.

44
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:11,329
Volcanic activity was likely responsible
for boosting atmospheric carbon dioxide

45
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,038
and creating a greenhouse effect.

46
00:03:14,038 --> 00:03:19,788
The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, 
55 million years ago,

47
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:24,371
was so warm, crocodiles swam the waters
of the Arctic Circle.

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:28,079
This warming may have been caused
by the drying of inland seas

49
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:31,829
and release of methane, 
a potent greenhouse gas,

50
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,829
from ocean sediments.

51
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:39,788
Even among these other warm periods,
you’re making a false analogy.

52
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:42,079
Yes, they had natural causes.

53
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,996
But each had a different cause,

54
00:03:43,996 --> 00:03:47,913
and involved a different amount 
and duration of warming.

55
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:50,871
They’re as dissimilar as they are similar.

56
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,288
Taking them together, 
all we can reasonably conclude

57
00:03:54,288 --> 00:03:56,913
is that the Earth’s climate 
seems to change

58
00:03:56,913 --> 00:04:00,371
in response to conditions on the planet.

59
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:05,829
Today, human activity is a dominant force
shaping conditions on your planet,

60
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:08,996
so the possibility that it’s driving
global warming

61
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:11,454
can’t be dismissed out of hand.

62
00:04:11,454 --> 00:04:14,204
I’ll grant that the more complicated 
something is,

63
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:17,745
the easier it is to make
a mistaken analogy.

64
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:22,954
That’s especially true because there are
many different types of false analogy:

65
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,871
that similar symptoms must share a cause,

66
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:30,913
that similar actions must lead to similar
consequences, and countless others.

67
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:35,913
Most false analogies you’ll come 
across are far less obvious

68
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:41,829
than those comparing apples to oranges, 
and climate is notoriously complex.

69
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,371
It requires careful, rigorous study
and evidence collection—

70
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:51,538
and making a false analogy like this
only impedes that process.

71
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,829
It’s 2013, and the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

72
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:06,788
has found, 
aggregating decades of research,

73
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:10,579
that there is more than a 95% chance 
the global warming trend

74
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:14,246
since the mid-20th century 
has been driven by human activity,

75
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,079
namely the burning of fossil fuels.

76
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,663
You’re both pets,

77
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:23,871
and he likes living in water,
so you should, too.
