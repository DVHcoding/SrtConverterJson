1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,319
Sometimes the world feels, hmm, boring.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:11,580
We've visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,200
But there is still one place to explore.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:22,960
It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,980
The deep sea.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,560
Let's dive down.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:35,420
[♫ Catchy Intro Jingle ♫]

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,980
When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans,

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,700
It's hard to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on Earth lives here.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:52,420
And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first 200 meters.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,680
This is where we begin our journey.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,120
Here, light can still penetrate the water which allows photosynthesis to occur.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,560
Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria make up the foundation

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,080
of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who are consumer by other species.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,500
The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with coral reefs, algae,

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,440
and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,820
So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment,

18
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,920
where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,920
So, let's dive deeper.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,860
Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the edge

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,960
of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope,

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,480
the long descent down to the deep sea.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,980
With every additional meter of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basically

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,100
no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of the Moon.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,740
Looking out we're faced by what seems to be endless open water.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,200
Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the Twilight Zone, the portal to the deep sea.

27
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,860
As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels.

28
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,100
The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters.

29
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,780
At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you.

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,340
Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey.

31
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,660
While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals

32
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,300
actually spend at least half their lives down here.

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,300
During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the vast dark waters.

34
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,360
At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface waters.

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,660
In this transition zone between Twilight and Darkness, light becomes a powerful tool.

36
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,100
Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment

37
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,840
use bioluminescence chemicals to create light.

38
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,480
They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight, to send signals to potential mates,

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,760
or to confuse and scare attackers.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,500
Or, they use lights to hunt.

41
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,680
Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork.

42
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,400
At around 700 meters, we encounter a colony of siphonophores.

43
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,420
They can be up to 50 metres in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick.

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,000
To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light,

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,960
and deploys a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close.

46
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,900
But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource: Marine Snow.

47
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,940
White flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean.

48
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,480
It consists of dead plant or animal parts,

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,640
fecal matter,

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,440
shells, sand, or dust.

51
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,880
Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the deep sea would starve.

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,740
It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could happen.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,620
Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house.

54
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,700
While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance,

55
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,940
but they do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin.

56
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,720
As we reach 1,000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful.

57
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,820
This is the Midnight Zone, a place of utter darkness.

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,140
A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water.

59
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,820
At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space.

60
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,240
Finding food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt, and become extremely energy-efficient.

61
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,600
Like the 30-centimeter-long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion,

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,400
with long and slender catching arms extended.

63
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:16,300
They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water.

64
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,700
This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food.

65
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,720
For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food since living prey is quite rare down here.

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:35,060
So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike. Otherwise, it will escape into the dark.

67
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,760
Many deep-sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth.

68
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,260
Like the viperfish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole.

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,060
Or the frilled shark, with its impressive set of 300 teeth,

70
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,440
which are curved backwards to hook their victims in their mouths.

71
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,640
We sink further.

72
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,600
Below the 3800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic, we are now at abyssal depths.

73
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,340
Here, life happens in slow motion.

74
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,320
Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival.

75
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,840
Everything down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion.

76
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,620
The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger.

77
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,780
Like the Dumbo octopod paddling with its ear-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with its slow eel-like tail beats.

78
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,540
At 4,000 meters, we've finally reached ground again. The Abyssal Plain.

79
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,400
It's covered in grey mud and rocks dusted with the remains of marine snow,

80
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,060
which is consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms.

81
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,060
In some regions of the seafloor, small dark mineral deposits can be seen.

82
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,160
These are manganese nodules.

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,360
Deep-sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea.

84
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,420
Though life is sparse on the deep sea floor, even down here there are oases.

85
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,560
In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater and creates dark jets

86
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,360
of water and minerals as hot as 400℃ (752℉), that form elaborate chimneys and towers.

87
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:31,060
Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances, that are the bases for unique ecosystems.

88
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,500
As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6,000 meters.

89
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,720
For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets, but if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans,

90
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,640
we're actually only halfway there.

91
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,400
Let's enter the Hadal Zone, the underworld of the sea.

92
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:59,420
It consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans, and are among

93
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,420
the most extreme environments on Earth.

94
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:09,360
Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish, that holds the record for deepest living fish

95
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,800
ever seen, at around 8,000 meters.

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,720
We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000.

97
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:26,040
Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently-sloping sides

98
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,440
that enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide.

99
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,240
This is it. The deepest point, the Challenger Deep.

100
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,300
11,000 meters below the surface.

101
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:42,299
The water pressure here is 1,086 bar.

102
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,120
Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1,800 elephants on top of you.

103
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,920
But even here, life has found a way to thrive.

104
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,880
Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water.

105
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,420
Their size is astounding.

106
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,600
While their shallow-water cousins are maybe a few centimetres long, the deep-sea version

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,620
can reach up to 30 centimeters.

108
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,620
And there are other things floating elegantly through the water.

109
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,840
Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018.

110
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,940
Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence.

111
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,220
There's nothing left to do now and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent.

113

After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light.

We arrive back at a calm surface.

115

The oceans are so deep. There is so much of them.
