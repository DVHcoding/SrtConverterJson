1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,350
I'm not suffering though I think it's beautiful.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:07,569
Tonight, we step off the train in Anchorage,
Alaska where we're greeted by a historic snowstorm

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:08,569
but

4
00:00:08,569 --> 00:00:13,000
despite the weather we're excited to share
with you the beauty of the Aurora winter train.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,250
We hope we get lucky enough tonight to see
the Northern Lights.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,330
fingers crossed

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,939
Join us as we embark on a 12-hour journey
across Alaska from Fairbanks to Anchorage.

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,840
We'll show you exactly what it's like to experience
this famous train ride

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,250
from the food, train, a famous passenger we meet

10
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,250
and of course

11
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,230
the pretty incredible views that make this
adventure truly unforgettable!

12
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,739
We do want to thank incogni for sponsoring this video.

13
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,924
It's 4 30 a.m in North Pole Alaska where we're
starting this journey.

14
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:49,702
It's way too early.

15
00:00:49,702 --> 00:00:51,457
We only slept two hours.

16
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:53,145
My brains not working.

17
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:55,420
I want to sleeeeeeeep.

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,449
Before getting to the train station, we had
to pack up our bags, clean up the rental cabin,

19
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,291
load everything into the car and then we hear this...

20
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,110
DO YOU HAVE MY PHONE?

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,952
I don't have it.

22
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:05,847
It's either the wallet,

23
00:01:05,847 --> 00:01:07,757
the keys or the phone.

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,670
Please tell me we're not the only couple that
does this.

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,890
Right there sweetie.

26
00:01:13,047 --> 00:01:14,227
goodbye

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,292
Let's go.

28
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,100
We then needed to fill the car up with gas,
find a parking spot at the airport,

29
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,330
and get all of our things out of the car,
deliver the car keys to the rental agency,

30
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,330
Oh, the mileage?

31
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:30,724
oh we didn't see you...

32
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,310
Bye bye... we wanted to.

33
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,830
and then catch a taxi to the train station.

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,440
We're going to...

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
the railroad station.

36
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:37,756
Yes, oh... how did you know?

37
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:38,677
Fairbanks Railroad Station

38
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:45,679
Thankfully, we made it in time to check our
bags, get our tickets and we still had a few minutes left before boarding.

39
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:48,573
What a morning this has been already.

40
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:52,808
Last night we were up all night searching
for the Northern Lights which if you haven't

41
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:57,320
seen our first Alaska video make sure you
check that out but after you watch this video.

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,446
Here we are at the Fairbanks train station
and we have about 10 minutes before we board our train...

43
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:05,576
which we're so excited to take!

44
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:06,551
4 YEARS AGO

45
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:10,699
I was really excited to take this train ride
but I kept remembering about four years ago

46
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:14,440
the last time we took a 12-hour train ride...

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,450
it was um...

48
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,140
it's probably my worst decision I've ever made!

49
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,180
We're boarding now.

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,629
We're gonna be the first ones. The first time,
we're the first one.

51
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:28,320
Something that stood out for us even before
we stepped on the train was how nice the staff was.

52
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:31,059
"those are for tomorrow"

53
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:32,715
"you're going for today?"

54
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,146
"no, I'm just teasing"

55
00:02:34,146 --> 00:02:35,281
Oh my gosh, that scared us.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,291
"you got pretty scared though."

57
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,170
Well, because that's typical for us.

58
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,670
and also they had a great sense of humor.

59
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,860
oh my gosh, I had a heart attack.

60
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:52,768
On the Aurora winter train, only the adventure class
is available which means all the seats and services are the same.

61
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:57,950
The entire train consisted only of the engine two passenger cars and a single Dining Car.

62
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,230
It has large windows and the seats are pretty
comfortable.

63
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,752
oh yeah that's us.

64
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:04,067
Do you want to go there?

65
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:06,803
We haven't seen a moose so I'm gonna see a
moose on the train.

66
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:09,475
We want to do um beverages available now.

67
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,054
Coffee?

68
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:10,713
Yes.

69
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:11,345
Let's go.

70
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,000
Coffee as well.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,500
One?

72
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,027
Two.

73
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:13,635
Two.

74
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:16,931
I have a feeling we're going to need a lot
of coffee today...

75
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,626
and some slaps.

76
00:03:20,005 --> 00:03:21,016
Harder.

77
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:21,579
Just kidding.

78
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,192
It's going to be $5 even.

79
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,000
Here you go.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,850
Thank you love.

81
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,850
Thank you.

82
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:27,902
To a good train ride.

83
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,875
Minute one of a 12 hour train ride.

84
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:32,900
All Aboard.

85
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,426
Choo Choo

86
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:35,860
Before we go, I need to check something.

87
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,190
Are you like me and subscribe to every newsletter,

88
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,080

91
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,580
without your knowledge.

92
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,470
I was shocked when I found out how

93
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,689
many data breaches my personal information
was in when I ran it through Incogni.

94
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,560

phone number,

102
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:08,046
purchasing history,

103
00:04:08,046 --> 00:04:09,046
interests,

104
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:09,625

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,509

113
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,950
Time for breakfast.

114
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,699
We're only 30 minutes into the ride and we
are invited for breakfast which takes place

115
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,605
in the car right in front of ours.

116
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,740
We have the breakfast burrito with reindeer? oh that was me.

117
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,389
Aurora breakfast with bacon.

118
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,389
thank you.

119
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,110
Bernardo went for a more classic option while
I chose something a bit different: the burrito

120
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,949
with scrambled eggs, hash potatoes, shredded
cheese and something I had never tried before

121
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:02,949
reindeer sausage.

122
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,139
Sorry Rudolph, this is very good.

123
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,584
We have an hour and 30 minutes before the
sunrise so we're gonna try to sleep a little bit.

124
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:12,819
Good night, see you in five hours.

125
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,600
Well coffee didn't really help me and I fell
asleep as soon as we got back to our seats.

126
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,729
It did keep Bernardo awake though.

127
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:25,660
About two hours into the journey, now totally
awake, we passed by the small town of Nenana.

128
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,629
Where about 40 people reside.

129
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:32,836
From this point, on a sunny day, the passengers
are granted with a great view of Denali

130
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:34,883
the tallest mountain in North America.

131
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:43,100
but since it's not a sunny day we didn't get
to see a lot of it... well maybe next time.

132
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,471
Anywhere along the tracks, you might be able to
spot some of Alaska's famous wild animals.

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,889
You can't take a nap on this train because
they say you're going to see animals.

134
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:56,751
Wake me up if you see anything, okay?

135
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,649
I'll do my best.

136
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:00,149
We might see wolves,

137
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:01,149
minks,

138
00:06:01,674 --> 00:06:02,674
coyotes

139
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:03,648
porcupines

140
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:04,280
porcupines?

141
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,543
I'm kidding.

142
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:07,200
I was like, porcupines are here?

143
00:06:07,937 --> 00:06:11,356
There's a lot of information... look to the left.

144
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,829
Look to the right.

145
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,224
Two o'clock.

146
00:06:14,224 --> 00:06:15,209
Four o'clock

147
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,698
and I never know what 2 o'clock is.

148
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:19,042
It has to be fast, you can't think.

149
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,683
And I'm like, 2 o'clock... where's 2 o'clock.

150
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,918
and then you get to 2 o'clock... nope, 5 o'clock.

151
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,300
And the best part is the train crew seems
to know the best places to spot them.

152
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,539
"along side the Indian river here"

153
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,473
This is where we can see a moose.

154
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:30,974
This is the time.

155
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:32,587
This is the time.

156
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,868
"now about the 5 o'clock position now"

157
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:36,000
"he's posing for us"

158
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,876
"when there is one, there is probably more."

159
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,319
We saw a moose.

160
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,080
We've seen 1 moose so far.  The whole trip. 

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,234
I thought that we would see a bunch of moose.

162
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:51,155
So far, just 1.

163
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:52,716
Well, at least we saw one.

164
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,113
At least we saw one.

165
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,627
in the summer Denali National Park is a popular stop, where people head off on excursions sometimes for days.

166
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:06,209
During winter time though, Denali becomes kind of a ghost town and you don't see much happening around there.

167
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:08,982
STOP ONE: DENALI

168
00:07:08,982 --> 00:07:16,304
The stop was extremely fast just long enough for us to catch some fresh and cold air and take a picture.

169
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,287
We had a pretty fast stop at Denali,

170
00:07:18,287 --> 00:07:21,751
like around five minutes but so we're gonna have lunch.

171
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:28,755
All right time for lunch.  I'm hungry.

172
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:34,100
Unlike breakfast, lunch was packed so we shared tables with another couple.

173
00:07:35,126 --> 00:07:40,851
Bernardo got the soup of the day which was Buffalo chili, while I went for a regular burger.

174
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,511
Lunch was okay honestly nothing extraordinary but pretty good for train food.

175
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:01,480
When we got back to our seats it felt like
the scenery kept getting more impressive by the minute.

176
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,759
Being in one of the world's most scenic Railways most of us were trying to capture as most

177
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,060
of the scenery as possible

178
00:08:18,424 --> 00:08:22,936
Sometimes, we did have to remind ourselves to leave the
camera aside,

179
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:27,015
be in the moment and truly enjoy the journey.

180
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:31,065
He's trying to get some good shots.

181
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:38,359
During winter time in the part of Alaska sunsets are around 2:40pm in the afternoon and soon

182
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,628
it started getting dark again.

183
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:46,128
Despite the few hours of light, we promise you the train ride is totally worth it...

184
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:48,456
especially if we get the chance to see the Northern Lights.

185
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:49,587
Coffee time!

186
00:08:52,163 --> 00:08:53,452
I'm getting sleepy again.

187
00:08:54,241 --> 00:09:00,000
The guides and conductors seem to know every single Village and person alongside the entire route,

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,340
including this inspiring and also very famous woman we met Shannon Cartwright.

189
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,971
You live the life we want to live.

190
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:08,531
Really?

191
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:09,031
yeah

192
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:14,857
We're lucky to have met Shannon. She's a very talented illustrator who's worked on many children's books...

193
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:15,411
You drew all of this?

194
00:09:15,411 --> 00:09:16,149
I drew all this.

195
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:17,439
Wow!  You have a cool job.

196
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:18,701
All of them about Alaska.

197
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:19,201
I have fun.

198
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:25,398
For decades she's built a nomadic secluded life in Alaska in this pretty incredible off-grid cabin.

199
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:30,349
She has lived far away from the road system and has never owned a TV or a computer.

200
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,787
She was telling us many interesting stories of her life in the wilderness.

201
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,376
I've had many confrontations with bears.

202
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,234
I had a scarier experience with a moose...

203
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:41,493
trying to kill me.

204
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:45,380
The moose all of a sudden started
charging across the pond

205
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,640
and the moose chased me around a tree...

206
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,504
it was very scary.

207
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:53,149
She now has a partner who lives with her and also this super cute dog

208
00:09:54,842 --> 00:10:00,223
About every two weeks they flagged down
this train and go into the closest city to get supplies.

209
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:03,653
Do you have any advice for people who would like to live in the woods?

210
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,393
uh go do it now!

211
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:06,945
oh really.

212
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,513
Do it while you're young.

213
00:10:08,513 --> 00:10:09,079
Yeah.

214
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,953
Let's go... let's go.

215
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,500
Thanks for listening.

216
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,172
Careful.

217
00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:16,618
STOP TWO: TALKEETNA

218
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:20,748
Talkeetna, was our second and last stop and it was even shorter than the first one about three minutes.

219
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:27,030
It's snowing! This is really the first time yeah that we're seeing snow here.

220
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:34,982
but that's okay though because at this point we're both feeling really tired and ready to get to our final destination.

221
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:38,724
... and we met the world's famous woman in Alaska...

222
00:10:38,724 --> 00:10:40,402
no not the world's famous.

223
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:42,695
and we met Alaska's...

224
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:46,398
and we met Alaska's most famous woman (one of)

225
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:47,292
All aboard!

226
00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:51,284
but since we still have a few hours left, it's time for dinner.

227
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:55,745
We're trying all the food, we had breakfast, we had lunch and now we're gonna try dinner.

228
00:10:56,981 --> 00:10:57,992
I'm not even that hungry.

229
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:00,528
I have the roast...

230
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:02,397
and salmon chowder.

231
00:11:02,397 --> 00:11:06,125
Is it good?  I think this is my favorite meal.

232
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:10,571
How is it?

233
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,848
This was my favorite too.

234
00:11:13,848 --> 00:11:19,230
The woman, she said thanks for dining, you guys are breathtaking.

235
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,808
Awe, that's sweet.

236
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:23,308
The staff here are so nice.

237
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,793
yeah. It's sweet.

238
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:40,169
Two more hours to go.

239
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:42,212
I can't wait to get there.

240
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:43,343
Me too.

241
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:50,728
To play it safe, we're gonna pick up a relief crew along the way just in case we do need to switch over to the relief crew.

242
00:11:50,728 --> 00:11:52,548
30 minutes until Anchorage.

243
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,929
uh there's a big snowstorm.

244
00:11:54,929 --> 00:12:01,208
"It's hard just to stand up.  Wind gusts that reached up to 80 miles (129 kph) an hour.

245
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,282
Should be fun.

246
00:12:02,282 --> 00:12:05,724
I think that will be fun. I'm excited to see snow.

247
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,224
Aren't you?

248
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,031
We've seen a bunch of snow...

249
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:10,641
No, I want to see snow falling.

250
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:13,160
We still don't have a hotel booked there.

251
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,576
We'll probably be walking to the hotel,
so that should be fun.

252
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:17,280
30 MINUTES LATER:

253
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,394
I don't think that's the right way.

254
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:24,068
Disclaimer: we didn't see the Aurora lights in this train.

255
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:27,504
It's way too cloudy for us to see the Aurora, so...

256
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,530
Yeah. Not this time.

257
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:41,310
Is it bad if I want to say I can't wait to get off?

258
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:46,485
Our time here on the winter Aurora train, has come to an end.

259
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:47,451
12 hours.

260
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:49,486
Did you have a good time?

261
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:53,579
I did it was nice, the scenery was nice,

262
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,709
but I'm... the lights have been on for 12 hours so I think I'm ready for some darkness.

263
00:12:58,709 --> 00:12:59,209
Me too...

264
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:00,261
and a bathtub.

265
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:04,468
Gotta put on the gloves because Bernardo says... "it's cold outside."

266
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:06,215
Just put on your gloves.

267
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:09,398
Very good, good job.

268
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,055
Ohhhhhh!

269
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:12,212
Oh wow!

270
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,665
Thank you... absolutely. Good luck.

271
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:18,403
Thank you so much, thank you so much. Have a good day... have a good one.

272
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:20,667
It's snowing!

273
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:31,671
We made it to Anchorage in the midst of a record-breaking snowfall.

274
00:13:31,671 --> 00:13:39,194
We managed to get our hotel reservation at the train station but we were having some trouble with our GPS...

275
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,946
or maybe my listening.

276
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,564
Okay now we just gotta figure out how to get to the hotel.

277
00:13:43,564 --> 00:13:48,494
If you like the snow as much as we do... give this video a thumbs up.

278
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,139
If you like to watch us suffering walking in the snow...

279
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:56,038
I'm not suffering... not knowing where to go... give it a thumbs up.

280
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:57,647
I don't think that's the right way.

281
00:13:57,647 --> 00:14:00,276
So that's the Hilton, I think that's the downtown.

282
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,487
We gotta go up this way (hotel is to the left).

283
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:03,918
It's over this way, I'm sure (it's to the right).

284
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,700
I just wish one of us was good with directions.

285
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,167
Actually...  it's not the other way.

286
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,719
We keep going. (He's right... we keep going.)

287
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,465
You pretty much balance each other pretty well except...

288
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:16,728
What?

289
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:19,526
the both of us are horrible directions!

290
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:20,578
Where are you going?

291
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:21,889
I think we go up... (the hotel is the opposite way)

292
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:24,207
If Hilton's there all the other hotels are there.

293
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:32,396
Okay okay, yes, Bernardo was right again,
I was wrong and we ended up walking 15 minutes the wrong way...

294
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:36,464
but in my defense don't you
think all hotels would be around the Hilton?

295
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:38,978
Oh this is pretty.

296
00:14:39,451 --> 00:14:40,338
Snowball fight.

297
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:40,838
Don't.

298
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:45,242
We haven't had a snowball fight.

299
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,620
It's here!

300
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:52,971
This is the happiest moment of my life.

301
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:58,702
The hotel was actually pretty close to the train station, only a 5 minute walk.

302
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:01,897
Believe it or not I'm sweating and I'm hot but my hands are cold.

303
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:04,630
I guess I should have listened to you.

304
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,394
You should have, I told you it was here.

305
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:12,415
All right we're definitely going to sleep well tonight.

306
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:17,019
Yeah, it's so silent... there's no snow blowing on our faces.

307
00:15:22,015 --> 00:15:26,268
(music) - "Oh the weather outside is frightful,"

308
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:28,850
"and the fire is so..."

309
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,024
"delightful..."

310
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:30,763
Oh you know it.

311
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,444
"and since we have no place to go"

312
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:35,404
"Let is snow,

313
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,317
let is snow,

314
00:15:36,317 --> 00:15:37,994
let it snow"

315
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:39,543
LET IT SNOW.

316
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:45,699
As we say goodbye to Alaska we want to take a moment to reflect on this incredible journey we've shared together.

317
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:52,011
This trip has reminded us that life is meant to be lived fully and with a sense of adventure.

318
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,536
When we get to a place we always say...

319
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,334
"let's see what happens here in Alaska"

320
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:02,590
so... we made some great memories here
and we'll always remember the first time we saw the Northern Lights,

321
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,774
went dog sledding

322
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:06,335
and the wonderful people who've crossed our way.

323
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,503
Thank you for joining us on this journey

324
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:11,265
oh welcome to Alaska...

325
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:14,921
and for allowing us to be a part of your life.

326
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,886
Let's continue to make unforgettable
memories together.

327
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,501
yeah, but it was fun.

328
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,376
It was really fun.
