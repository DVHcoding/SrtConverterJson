1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,420
I never really planned to be a lifeboat volunteer when I came to live in Northsea.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,680
I'd been working in London as a website designer,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,060
but although that was interesting, I didn't like city life.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,000
I'd been really keen on boats as a teenager,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,900
and I thought if I went to live by the sea.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,880
I might be able to pursue that interest a bit more in my free time.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,320
Then I found that the Lifeboat Institution was looking for volunteers,

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,640
so I decided to apply.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,020
The Lifeboat Institution building here in Northsea's hard to miss,

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,700
it's one of the largest in the country.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,580
It was built 15 years ago with funds provided by a generous member of the public who'd lived here all her life.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,420
As the Lifeboat Institution is a charity that relies on that kind of donation,

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,220
rather than funding provided by the government,

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,440
that was a huge help to us.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,320
When I applied, I had to have a health assessment.

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,140
The doctors were particularly interested in my vision.

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,060
I used to be short-sighted,

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,340
so I'd had to wear glasses,

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,800
but I'd had laser eye surgery two years earlier so that was okay.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,420
They gave me tests for colour blindness

21
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,900
and they thought I might have a problem there,

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,520
but it turned out I was okay.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,380
When the coastguard gets an alert,

24
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,660
all the volunteers are contacted and rush to the lifeboat station.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,000
Our target's to get there in five minutes,

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,360
then we try to get the boat off the dock and out to sea in another six to eight minutes.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,700
Our team's proud that we usually achieve that.

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,460
The average time across the country's 8.5 minutes.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,260
I've recently qualified as what's called a 'helmsman',

30
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,440
which means I have the ultimate responsibility for the lifeboat.

31
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,340
I have to check that the equipment we use is in working order,

32
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,820
the crew have special life jackets that can support up to four people in the water.

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,420
And it's ultimately my decision whether it's safe to launch the boat.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,740
But it's very rare not to launch it, even in the worst weather.

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,220
As well as going out on the lifeboat, my work involves other things too.

36
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,940
A lot of people underestimate how quickly conditions can change at sea,

37
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,000
so I speak to youth groups and sailing clubs in the area

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,040
about the sorts of problems that sailors and swimmers can have if the weather suddenly gets bad.

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,640
We also have a lot of volunteers who organise activities to raise money for us,

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,040
and we couldn't manage without them.

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,760
The training we get is a continuous process,

42
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,900
focusing on technical competence and safe handling techniques,

43
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,320
and it's given me the confidence to deal with extreme situations without panicking.

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,320
I was glad I'd done a first aid course before I started,

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,320
as that's a big help with the casualty care activities we do.

46
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,140
We've done a lot on how to deal with ropes and tie knots,

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,140
that's an essential skill.

48
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,240
After a year, I did a one-week residential course, led by specialists.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,920
They had a wave-tank where they could create extreme weather conditions,

50
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,860
so we could get experience of what to do if the boat turned over in a storm at night, for example.

51
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,120
Since I started, I've had to deal with a range of emergency situations.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,060
But the work's hugely motivating.

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,940
It's not just about saving lives.

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,340
I've learned a lot about the technology involved.

55
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,580
My background in IT's been useful here,

56
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,220
and I can use my expertise to help other volunteers.

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,020
They're a great group, we're like a family really,

58
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,500
which helps when you're dragging yourself out of bed on a cold stormy night.

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,980
But actually, it's the colder months that can be the most rewarding time.

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,180
That's when the incidents tend to be more serious,

61
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,480
and you realise that you can make a huge difference to the outcome.

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
So if any of you listeners are interested....
