00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,600
it was a long time ago that a hard-working farmer lived in a village in India

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,780
he had two sons

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,050
the farmer's Elder son was very honest and hardworking

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,290
he took great care of his father

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,610
and apart from doing all the household work

6
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,340
he also helped him in farming

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,320
the other son was idle and spent his days in fun

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,710
he was always busy dreaming

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,310
one day the farmer asked his younger son to learn some trade

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,550
the farmer said to his younger son that you are no longer a child

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,030
if you learn the trade then you will not have to face sorrow when you grow up

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,270
I had absolutely no faith in my younger son earning his living slowly through hard work and honesty

13
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,880
he used to dream of becoming Amir in one go

14
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,170
that's why he said to his father

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,720
father I want to earn money in a different way

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,960
and I want to live separately from you people by doing business separately

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,040
so give me some money

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,040
I want to do business with that money

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,000
the father felt a little little bad after listening to his son

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,010
but he thought that on this pretext he too would learn something and start working

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,680
so the farmer said son I don't have that much money to give you

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,620
but I will give you a pot of good butter

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,510
you take it to the market and sell it

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,960
you will get a good price from it which will help you in doing business

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,110
the son agreed to this thinking that he would get a very good price for the Desi butter

26
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,840
the farmer's son was surprised

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,850
just then a cow herd passed by with a herd of calves

28
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:30,760
oh yes I can buy a cow with that money

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,050
the cow will give me milk

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,240
I will sell the milk

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,960
with that money I will buy a field

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,520
I will also buy a pair of oxen to plow the field

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,690
I will then grow crops and have a beautiful I will marry the girl

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,430
the farmer's son kept dreaming while walking

35
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,470
unfortunately he did not see the bull

36
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,050
who was sitting on the road

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,130
the farmer's son collided with the bull and fell on the ground

38
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,150
along with this the pot of local butter hanging on on his head also broke

39
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,150
and all the butter fell on the ground

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,390
he started cursing the bull

41
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,830
you stupid animal

42
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,080
you ruined my life

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,310
I lost all my butter

44
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,180
I lost the goat

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,240
I lost the cow

46
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,820
I lost my farm and Bulls

47
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,530
I lost everything saying this he kicked the bull

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,520
the bull also got angry and hit the farmer's son hard with his sharp horn

49
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,970
he went too far and fell into the mud and got badly injured

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,680
he ran away and started crying towards his home

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,180
all his dreams were shattered
