00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,130
Hello and welcome to another
episode of elephant English podcast

2
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,170
today

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,510
i'm going to talk
about my daily routines.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,920
I normally do the
same things every week

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,160
but some days i do
different though things.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,780
In the united kingdom
Sunday is normally considered

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,530
the first day on the calendar so

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,931
i'm going to tell you what i
normally do on sundays first.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,580
So for me sundays of
arresting and relaxing

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:44,610
in the the morning i cleaned the
living room the kitchen and the bathroom

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,910
when i have finished
cleaning i make lunch.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,450
I normally cook a lot of food

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,850
because then i can eat

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,390
it

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,940
on Monday or Tuesday for example

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,310
and that way

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,770
i don't have how
to cook every day.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,360
In the afternoon.

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,250
I usually watch the
formula one race

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:08,970
but

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,800
there aren't racist every week.

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,980
Finally in the evening

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,410
i prepare my
classes for the week

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
because i am a teacher.

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,360
Mondays Tuesdays wednesdays
and Thursdays a very similar for me

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,140
but Monday's are definitely
the worst day of the week.

27
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,850
I don't like mondays
because i am very tired

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,640
and because the
days feel very long.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,030
When i wake up on these days

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,680
i i brush my teeth i get
dressed i brush my hair

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:49,690
i have breakfast and then
i go to work at seven thirty.

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,100
I always have my lunch at work

33
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,210
because then

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,890
i don't have to prepare it.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,990
In the UK

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,290
people normally have
breakfast in the morning

37
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,700
after they wake up

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,540
and they normally
have some cereals a milk

39
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,460
and a cup of coffee

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,540
or a cup of tea.

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,160
Then

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,850
at twelve o'clock or one
o'clock they have their lunch

43
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,950
which is normally a some weight

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,740
a salad or something
else that is quite small.

45
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,590
I come home

46
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,879
at five pm

47
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,260
and after that

48
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,920
i sometimes have extra
English classes in the evenings

49
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,590
i normally have dinner

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,870
and before i go to bed

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,190
i pay with my cat because she has got
a lot of energy if i don't play with my cat

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,410
she doesn't sleep at night

53
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:49,031
so this is an important
thing for me to do.

54
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,980
In the UK people
normally have dinner

55
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,450
at six o'clock

56
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,130
or a bit later

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,100
when they come back from work
this is the biggest meal of the day

58
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,690
and the typical

59
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,160
British dinner is a roast dinner
which includes some meat

60
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,600
chicken or fish

61
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:12,450
i then saw potatoes

62
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:16,540
and vegetables other
vegetables like carrots

63
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,180
broccoli or piece.

64
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,190
However

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,280
people obviously
don't eat this every day

66
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,510
and

67
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,800
they might eat

68
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,277
pasta dinner a curry

69
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,930
a pie or or something like that.

70
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,080
Before going to bed

71
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,060
some people have a snack

72
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,080
that is called supper.

73
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,430
Depending

74
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,220
on if you are hungry or not

75
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,380
people will have a bigger

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,361
or a smaller supper.

77
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,610
On Fridays i normally happier
because it is the weekend.

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,740
In the evening i go for a
walk or what a series on Netflix

79
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,380
i like Fridays but i don't
have a lot of energy so

80
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,170
i normally relax
and stay at home.

81
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,300
Finally

82
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,160
i normally eat out on Saturdays

83
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:16,450
my favorite type of restaurants are Italian
restaurants because i love pizza and pasta.

84
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,309
After eating dinner

85
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,800
i go to the supermarket
or to the shopping centre

86
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,050
