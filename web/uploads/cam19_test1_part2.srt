1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,020
It's great to see so many members of the Twinning Association here tonight.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:15,400
Since the twinning link between our two towns, Stanthorpe here in England and Malatte in France, was established,

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,500
the relationship between the towns has gone from strength to strength.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:28,260
Last month, 25 members of the association from Stanthorpe spent a weekend in Malatte.

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,260
Our hosts had arranged a great programme.

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,920
We learned how cheese is produced in the region

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,660
and had the chance to taste the products.

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,160
The theme park trip had to be cancelled,

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,100
but we all had a great time on the final boat trip down the river,

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,460
This is a special year for the Association

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:57,340
because it's 25 years since we were founded.

12
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:04,160
In Malatte, they're planning to mark this by building a footbridge in the municipal park.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,400
We've been discussing what to do here

14
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,560
and we've decided to plant a poplar tree in the museum gardens.

15
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,440
We considered buying a garden seat to put there,

16
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,700
but the authorities weren't happy with that idea.

17
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,520
In terms of fundraising to support our activities,

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,520
we've done very well.

19
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,220
Our pancake evening was well attended and made record profits.

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,620
And everyone enjoyed the demonstration of French cookery,

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,040
which was nearly as successful.

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,260
Numbers for our film show were limited because of the venue

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,640
so we're looking for somewhere bigger next year.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,240
We're looking forward to welcoming our French visitors here next week,

25
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,720
and I know that many of you here will be hosting individuals or families.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,540
The coach from France will arrive at 5 pm on Friday.

27
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,920
Don't try to do too much that first evening as they'll be tired,

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,880
so have dinner in the house or garden rather than eating out.

29
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,080
The weather looks as if it'll be okay

30
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,100
so you might like to plan a barbecue.

31
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,740
Then the next morning's market day in town,

32
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,940
and that's always a good place to stroll round.

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,080
On Saturday evening, we'll all meet up at the football club,

34
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,020
where once again we'll have Toby Sharp and his band

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,600
performing English and Scottish country songs.

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,480
Toby will already be well known to many of you

37
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,600
as last year he organised our special quiz night and presented the prizes.

38
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,080
Now on Sunday, we'll be taking our visitors to Farley House.

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,900
You may not all be familiar with it, so here's a map to help you.

40
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,640
You can see the car park at the bottom of the map.

41
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,020
There's an excellent farm shop in the grounds where our visitors can buy local produce,

42
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,000
it's in the old stables, which is the first building you come to.

43
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,100
They're built round a courtyard, and the shop's in the far corner on the left.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,720
There's also a small cafÃ© on the right as you go in.

45
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:34,960
I know that one or two of our visitors may not be all that mobile.

46
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,860
The main entrance to the house has a lot of steps

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,480
so you might want to use the disabled entry.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,760
This is on the far side of the house from the car park.

49
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,360
Children will probably be most interested in the adventure playground.

50
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,320
That's at the northern end of the larger lake,

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,600
in a bend on the path that leads to the lake.

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,560
There's lots for children to do there.

53
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,160
There are a number of lovely gardens near the house.

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,160
The kitchen gardens are rectangular and surrounded by a wall.

55
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,980
They're to the north-east of the house, quite near the smaller lake.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,480
They're still in use and have a great collection of fruit and vegetables.

57
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,500
The Temple of the Four Winds is a bit more of a walk,

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,080
but it's worth it.

59
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,600
Take the path from the car park

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,420
and go past the western sides of the stables and the house.

61
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Then when the path forks, take the right-hand path.

62
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,200
Go up there with the woods on your left and the temple is right at the end.

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,960
There are great views over the whole area.
