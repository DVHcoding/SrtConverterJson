00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,888
in the past few months there has been a surge of interest in the outdoors

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,904
and in particular wild camping

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,592
while much of this has been done responsibly

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,824
there has been a lot of cases where people have camped in appropriately

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,824
leaving their equipment and their litter behind like a scar on the countryside

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,024
instead of moaning about the problem

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,560
i thought i'd be proactive

i arrived fairly late last night

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,840
which is good practice if you want to be discreet

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:37,856
i picked a nice level spot far away from any footpaths

with good cover from the wind

19
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,600
here i'm using a sit pad that i made out of some old foam

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:47,632
and insulation foil it helps to keep my bone warm and dry

this is the container i use to hold methylated spirit

28
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,520
i don't usually bother with a kettle

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,520
as this 750ml pot can boil enough water for a coffee and some food

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,976
while also keeping a relatively low pack size and weight

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,872
i recently bought this three-piece cutlery set from go outdoors 

32
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:55,280
for around two pound fifty

a really handy tip if you are heading out wild camping 

39
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,480
is to take a couple of ziplock bags

i always like to pack a small cloth in my kit 

50
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,950
for drying out cups and pans after using them

53
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:24,560
if i'm camping on my own then i always pack two head torches

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,312
this one was around 10 pound from amazon

55
00:03:28,912 --> 00:03:31,696
i won't go into too much detail about sleeping bags 

56
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,984
as they really are a personal preference 

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,736
just be sure to pick up a bag with the right temperature ratings for the season you want to use it

58
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,608
the sleeping setup that i use

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
 is a combination of a sleeping bag

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:42,720

all of this sits on top of a standard foam roll pad

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,640
another little handy tip 

64
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:57,510
is to put all of your bags for your sleep system and gear

into your empty tent bag

that way it's really easy to find when packing away in the morning

68

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,448
any old bit of elastic can come in really handy 

77
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:09,824
when trying to keep your foam roll mat rolled up and secure

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
the tent i use is the lunch on two 

79
00:05:15,744 --> 00:05:19,648
which uses trekking poles to pitch instead of traditional temples 

80
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:21,760
