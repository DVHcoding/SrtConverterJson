00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,020
Hi Coleman, how are you?

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,380
Good, thanks.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,420
I wanted to have a chat with you

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,320
because our friend Josh told me that you've joined a guitar group

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,600
and it sounds interesting.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,060
I'd really like to learn myself.

7
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,180
Why don't you come along?

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,680
I'm sure there's room for another person.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,900
Really?

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,080
So... who runs the classes?

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,780
He's called a 'coordinator',

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,820
his name's Gary Mathieson.

13
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,220
Let me note that down.

14
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,800
Gary....

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
How do you spell his surname?

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:48,160
It's Mathieson.

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,220
Right, thanks.

18
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,200
He's retired, actually, but he's a really nice guy

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,200
and he used to play in a lot of bands.

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,780
Thanks.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,260
So how long have you been going?

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,260
About a month now.

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,300
And could you play anything before you started?

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,680
I knew a few chords, but that's all.

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm sure everyone will be better than me.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,720
That's what I thought, too.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,600
When I first spoke to Gary on the phone,

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,580
he said it was a class for beginners,

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,400
but I was still worried that everyone would be better than me,

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,740
but we were all equally hopeless!

31
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,100
Oh, that's reassuring.

32
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,820
So where do you meet?

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,540
Well, when I joined the group, they were meeting in Gary's home,

34
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:46,580
but as the group got bigger, he decided to book a room at the college in town.

35
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,780
I prefer going there.

36
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,860
I know that place.

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,460
I used to go to tap dancing classes there when I was at secondary school.

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,560
I haven't been since, though and I can't remember what road it's in...

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,220
Is it Lock Street?

40
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:12,020
It's just beyond there at the bottom of New Street near the city roundabout.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,180
Yes, of course.

42
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,940
The guitar club is on the first floor in Room T347.

43
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,400
Right.

44
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,140
And when do you meet?

45
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Is it at the weekend?

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,600
We meet on Thursdays.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,400
It used to be 10.30 and that suited me well,

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,860
but now we meet at 11.

49
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,160
The class that's in there before us asked if they could have the room for another 30 minutes.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,040
Oh, I see.

51
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,680
Well, I'd love to come, but I don't have a guitar.

52
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,500
Well, you can always buy a second-hand one.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:04,080
There's a website called 'The perfect instrument' that sells all kinds of guitars, violins and so on.

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,920
I'm sure you'll find something there.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,100
So what's a typical lesson like with Gary?

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,540
Well, he always starts by getting us to tune our guitars.

57
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,140
That takes about five minutes.

58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,220
Uhuh...

59
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,860
Some people have an app they use, but others do it by ear.

60
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,800
Gary goes round and helps them.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,800
And while he's doing that, he tells us what he's going to do during the lesson.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,320
Right.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,400
First, we usually spend about ten minutes doing some strumming.

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,240
So is that using...

65
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,180
Oh... what are they called...

66
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,260
Plectrums?

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,460
No, we just use our thumbs.

68
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,460
Oh... much easier.

69
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:03,160
Gary reminds us where to put our fingers for each chord and then we play them together.

70
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,660
Sometimes we all just start laughing because we're so bad at keeping time,

71
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,520
so Gary starts clapping to help us.

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,380
Do you learn to play any songs?

73
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,920
Yes, we do at least one song with words and chords.

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,900
I mean that's harder than you think.

75
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,280
Oh, I'm sure it is!

76
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,700
That part of the lesson takes about 15 minutes.

77
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,820
He often brings a recording of the song and plays it to us first.

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,980
Then he hands out the song and if there's a new chord in it,

79
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:48,720
we practise that before we play it together, but really slowly.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,860
Do you do any finger picking?

81
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,200
That's the last ten minutes of the lesson,

82
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,040
when we pick out the individual notes from a tune he's made up.

83
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,300
It's always quite simple.

84
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,460
That must be hard, though.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,000
It is.

86
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,420
But people like it because they can really concentrate

87
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,400
and if we're all playing well, it sounds quite impressive.

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:23,620
The only trouble is that he sometimes gets us to play one at a time, you know, alone.

89
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,680
Oh... that's scary.

90
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,060
Um... it is, but I've got used to it now.

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,980
At the end he spends about five minutes telling us what to practise for the following week.

92
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,700
Well, thanks Coleman.

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,400
I'll go and have a look at that website, I think.
