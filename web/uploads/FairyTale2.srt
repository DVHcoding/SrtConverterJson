00:00:00,415 --> 00:00:02,706
Jack and the Beanstalk

2
00:00:04,118 --> 00:00:08,162
(A version of the tale by TheFableCottage.com)

3
00:00:09,824 --> 00:00:13,419
Once there was a young man named Jack.

4
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:19,822
He lived with his mother on a small farm
at the foot of the Foggy Mountains.

5
00:00:21,255 --> 00:00:24,148
Jack and his mother were very poor.

6
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:30,000
Their only way of making money was
selling the milk from their cow, Bess.

7
00:00:30,872 --> 00:00:34,700
One morning, Jack's mother
woke him up early.

8
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:37,510
It was still dark outside.

9
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,489
She was crying.

10
00:00:39,863 --> 00:00:42,050
"Jack, wake up!

11
00:00:42,363 --> 00:00:47,973
Go to the market today
and sell our cow, Bess."

12
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:53,234
"But why?" asked Jack, yawning.

13
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,646
"We need money to fix our house.

14
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:58,916
There are holes in the roof.

15
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:00,916
The windows are broken.

16
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:03,996
For heaven's sake, we have no front door.

17
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:06,287
Winter is coming soon.

18
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:10,406
If we don't fix the house,
the cold will kill us!"

19
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:17,703
Jack packed his bag and
fetched Bess from the barn.

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,819
As he was walking out the gate,
he heard his mother shout:

21
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:26,584
"She is worth at least five gold coins!

22
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:28,584
Don’t sell her for less!"

23
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:35,424
When Jack was half way to
the market, he met an old man.

24
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:40,456
"Good morning, my boy!"
said the old man.

25
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:43,141
"Where are you going today?"

26
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:46,657
"Good morning, sir," replied Jack.

27
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,716
"I'm going to the market
to sell my cow.

28
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,716
Her name is Bess."

29
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:56,478
"She is a beautiful cow," said the man.

30
00:01:56,603 --> 00:02:02,259
"I will buy Bess, and I will give you
a very good deal!"

31
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,550
“How much will you pay for her?

32
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,544
I won’t take less than
five gold coins!” said Jack.

33
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:12,788
“I don't have five gold coins," whispered the man.

34
00:02:12,954 --> 00:02:17,675
"But I have these five black beans!

35
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:24,699
These beans are magic beans!
They are worth more than gold!

36
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:32,120
If you take these beans, you will be
richer than the richest man in the world.”

37
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,341
Jack thought about his mother.

38
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:39,668
He thought about how happy
she would be if they were rich.

39
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:44,327
They could fix the roof, the windows,
and the front door.

40
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,345
Maybe they could buy a new cow!

41
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:53,374
“Okay," said Jack. "You’ve got a deal.
Give me the beans!"

42
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:57,846
Jack was very excited.

43
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,550
He ran home and showed
his mother the beans.

44
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,856
But instead of being happy,
she was furious.

45
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:13,944
“You foolish boy! You traded our
only cow for a handful of beans?!”

46
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,021
She took the beans and threw
them out the window.

47
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:22,722
Then she sat down beside
the fire and cried.

48
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,588
Jack was devastated.

49
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:30,544
He shut himself in his bedroom.

50
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:33,250
He felt so stupid.

51
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:38,634
They no longer had a cow,
and now they were poorer than before.

52
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:41,132
What a disaster!

53
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:43,942
And it was his fault!

54
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:58,000
The next morning when Jack opened
the curtains, he saw something very strange.

55
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:02,077
In the same place where his
mother had thrown the beans,

56
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:05,718
there was a giant, green beanstalk.

57
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:12,973
It stretched from the ground,
up, up, up… all the way to the clouds.

58
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:18,690
“The beans really are magic!”
whispered Jack.

59
00:04:18,795 --> 00:04:21,647
"The old man was telling the truth!"

60
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,973
Jack's mother was still asleep,

61
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:32,957
so Jack decided to climb the beanstalk
to look for the riches the old man had described.

62
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:37,159
"Just five gold coins," thought Jack.

63
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:40,135
That's all I need to make my mother happy."

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,555
Jack climbed up, up, up,
higher and higher into the clouds.

65
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:50,380
When he reached the top,
he was very hungry.

66
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:53,647
He saw a castle in the distance.

67
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:58,534
"Maybe I can find something to eat
in that castle…" he thought.

68
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:03,982
Jack walked up to the door of
the castle and knocked twice.

69
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:06,086
Knock knock!

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,415
A giantess opened the door.

71
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,017
She was as big as a house,

72
00:05:12,162 --> 00:05:16,156
but she had a warm smile
and gentle eyes.

73
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,109
"Excuse me, Mrs. Giant," said Jack.

74
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:25,619
"Could you please give me something to eat?
I am so hungry!"

75
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,132
"Oh you poor boy!" said the giantess.

76
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:33,171
She could see that Jack was very thin.

77
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:36,708
"Of course! Come in! Come in!"

78
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:41,097
The kind giantess gave Jack
some vegetable stew.

79
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:48,123
He was enjoying it so much that he didn't
notice when the kitchen table started to shake.

80
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:56,312
Stomp... Stomp... Stomp…
Loud footsteps echoed down the hallway.

81
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:59,828
"Oh dear," whispered the giantess.

82
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:03,884
"That is my husband!
He is home from work!

83
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:08,127
He doesn't like humans!
Quick! Hide!"

84
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,623
Jack hid in the pantry.

85
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:17,964
The giant stomped into the kitchen
and sniffed the air.

86
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:23,017
"FEE FI FO FUM! ...

87
00:06:24,907 --> 00:06:27,958
Hello my beautiful wife!

88
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:31,827
Wait! Do I smell a human man?

89
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,222
YUCK! WHERE IS HE?"

90
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:39,047
"Good evening, my darling husband,"
replied the giantess.

91
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,047
"There is nobody here.

92
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,792
You smell the vegetable stew,
nothing more."

93
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,039
"Good," grunted the giant.

94
00:06:48,143 --> 00:06:51,327
"I hate humans."

95
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,470
He sat down at the
table in the kitchen.

96
00:06:54,595 --> 00:07:00,000
The giant took out a small sack of gold coins
out of his pocket and counted them.

97
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:06,175
One... two... three... four... five gold coins.

98
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:09,401
Jack watched from inside the pantry.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,056
"Five gold coins!" thought Jack.

100
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:18,008
"If I had that money, I could fix our house!"

101
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,337
When the two giants left the room,

102
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:25,892
Jack stole the five gold coins
and slipped them into his bag.

103
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:30,000
"This is all I need!" thought Jack.

104
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:34,762
But then Jack remembered that
his family no longer had a cow.

105
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,694
Without a cow, they would surely starve.

106
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:43,124
He decided to stay and
look for other treasures.

107
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:48,899
He followed the giant into the living room
and hid under the couch.

108
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,786
The giant went to the cupboard
and pulled out a golden hen.

109
00:07:54,887 --> 00:07:57,635
“Hello, my beautiful hen!

110
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:04,163
Lay, please!" said the giant,
and the hen laid a golden egg.

111
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:09,051
Jack watched from under the couch.

112
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:13,829
"A hen that lays golden eggs!"
whispered Jack.

113
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:18,238
"If I had that hen,
I could buy FIFTY cows!"

114
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:23,258
When the giant left the room,
Jack crawled out from under the couch.

115
00:08:23,383 --> 00:08:27,439
He went to the cupboard, took the hen,
and put it in his bag.

116
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:31,578
"This is all I need… " thought Jack.

117
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,813
But then Jack thought about
what the old man had promised.

118
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:42,510
Jack imagined being richer than
the richest man in the world.

119
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:46,609
He decided to see what other
treasures he could find.

120
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:52,120
He followed the giant into the bedroom,
and hid under the bed.

121
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:57,381
There was a golden harp standing
in a corner of the room.

122
00:08:57,838 --> 00:09:04,154
"Hello, my beautiful harp. Play, please!"
said the giant.

123
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:09,602
The harp began playing music
with no one touching the strings.

124
00:09:13,901 --> 00:09:19,050
"Wow! A magic harp!" whispered Jack.

125
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,812
"That harp would make me
rich and famous!"

126
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:29,073
When the giant fell asleep,
Jack crawled out from under the bed.

127
00:09:29,073 --> 00:09:32,776
He took the magic harp
and put it in his bag.

128
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:36,579
But this time Jack was less lucky.

129
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,241
The magic harp screamed,

130
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:44,626
“Help me, master!
A human is stealing me!”

131
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:48,329
The giant woke up and saw Jack
with the magic harp,

132
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:51,679
the golden hen, and his gold coins.

133
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,634
"STOP, THIEF!"

134
00:09:55,174 --> 00:09:57,465
The giant chased Jack —

135
00:09:57,465 --> 00:10:03,116
— out of the bedroom, down the hallway,
through the kitchen, and out the front door.

136
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,778
But Jack was smaller
and faster than the giant.

137
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,834
Jack reached the beanstalk first
and slid down.

138
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,638
He arrived at the ground
with all his treasures.

139
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:20,484
The giant reached the top of
the beanstalk and looked down.

140
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,629
He was afraid of heights.

141
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:25,788
He slowly climbed down.

142
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:32,046
"BE CAREFUL, MY HUSBAND!"
shouted the giantess from the castle.

143
00:10:32,046 --> 00:10:35,521
"HUMANS CAN BE DANGEROUS!"

144
00:10:36,123 --> 00:10:39,307
Jack saw the giant coming
down the beanstalk.

145
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,886
So he ran into his house
and grabbed an axe.

146
00:10:43,094 --> 00:10:47,919
He chopped the beanstalk.
Whack! Whack! Whack!

147
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,726
Suddenly, the beanstalk snapped.

148
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:56,447
The giant came tumbling down from the sky.

149
00:10:57,714 --> 00:11:05,135
He fell down, down, down, and landed far away,
on the other side of the Foggy Mountains.

150
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:06,948
Thud!

151
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:12,049
For a moment everything was silent.

152
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:16,749
Then Jack heard a strange sound
from far away.

153
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:22,654
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo!"

154
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
It was the giant.

155
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,419
The beanstalk had fallen,

156
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:33,535
and now he had no way to get back up
to his castle in the clouds.

157
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:39,710
The giant yelled so loudly that
the clouds shook and turned gray.

158
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:46,383
Then somewhere up in the sky,
Jack heard Mrs. Giant start to cry.

159
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:52,782
Her tears fell through the clouds in tiny drops
and soaked the earth.

160
00:11:56,168 --> 00:12:00,598
After that, Jack and his mother
lived a very comfortable life.

161
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:04,509
The golden hen made a Jack a millionaire.

162
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:07,548
The magic harp made him famous.

163
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,390
Jack married a rich and famous woman
and together they had ten children.

164
00:12:13,992 --> 00:12:16,989
But Jack was never truly happy.

165
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,508
Every time the wind blew,

166
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:23,004
Jack heard the giant calling for his wife.

167
00:12:23,606 --> 00:12:25,435
And every time it rained,

168
00:12:25,435 --> 00:12:28,806
he felt the giant-wife's
tears falling on him.

169
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:32,317
Jack felt sad and guilty.

170
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,681
One day, when Jack was very old,

171
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:40,000
he decided that he didn't want
to be sad any more.

172
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:46,757
He opened a box on his mantelpiece and
pulled out one last shrivelled magic bean.

173
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:51,582
If he could find the giant,
he could grow another beanstalk.

174
00:12:51,873 --> 00:12:56,428
Then the giant could climb back up
to his castle in the clouds.

175
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,416
If he could find the giant, he could also
apologize for being so greedy.

176
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:07,178
Jack packed his bag and walked
into the Misty Mountains.

177
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,436
Did Jack find the giant?

178
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:17,846
Did he grow a new beanstalk
with the last magic bean?

179
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,000
Nobody knows.

180
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:25,385
But people say, if you listen closely
during a thunderstorm,

181
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:31,975
you can hear the rumbling sound of
two giants dancing together in the clouds.
