﻿Hello and welcome to another episode of Elephant 
English podcasts. Today I am going to talk about  

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,320
my daily routines. I normally do the same things 
every week but some days I do different things.  

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:30,640
In the United Kingdom, Sunday is normally the 
first day on the calendar, so I am going to  

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:40,000
tell you what I normally do on Sundays first.
For me, Sundays are for resting and relaxing. In  

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,560
the morning, I clean the living room, the kitchen 
and the bathroom. When I have finished cleaning,  

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:56,560
I make lunch. I normally cook a lot of food 
because then I can eat it on Monday or Tuesday,  

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:06,320
for example, and that way I don’t have to cook 
every day. In the afternoon, I usually watch  

8
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:14,960
the Formula 1 race, but there aren’t races every 
week. Finally, in the evening, I prepare my  

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,880
classes for the week because I am a teacher.
Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are  

10
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,800
very similar for me, but Mondays are definitely 
the worst day of the week. I don’t like Mondays  

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,520
because I am very tired and because the days feel 
very long. When I wake up on these days, I brush  

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:48,400
my teeth, I get dressed, I brush my hair, I have 
breakfast and then I go to work at 7.30am.
 

13
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,000
I always have my lunch at work because 
then I don’t have to prepare it. In the UK,  

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,800
people normally have breakfast in the morning 
after they wake up and they normally have some  

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:13,600
cereals and milk and a cup of coffee or a cup 
of tea. Then, at 12 o’clock or 1 o’clock they  

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,080
have their lunch, which is normally a sandwich, a 
salad or something else that is quite small.
 

17
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,480
I come home at 5pm and after that I 
sometimes have extra English classes  

18
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,960
in the evenings. I normally have dinner and 
before I go to bed I play with my cat because  

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,920
she has got a lot of energy. If I don’t play 
with my cat, she doesn’t sleep at night, so  

20
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:53,120
this is an important thing for me to do.
In the UK people normally have dinner  

21
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,320
at 6 o’clock or a bit later, when they 
come back from work. This is the biggest  

22
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:08,400
meal of the day and the typical British dinner 
is a roast dinner, which includes some meat,  

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:20,240
chicken or fish, some potatoes, some vegetables 
like carrots, broccoli or peas. However,  

24
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,760
people obviously don’t eat this every day, 
and they might eat a pasta dinner, curry,  

25
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:37,520
a pie or something like that. Before going to bed, 
some people have a snack that is called supper.  

26
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,840
Depending on if you are hungry or not, people 
will have a bigger or a smaller supper.
 

27
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,360
On Fridays, I am normally happier because 
it is the weekend. In the evening I go for  

28
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:00,800
a walk or watch a series on Netflix. I like 
Fridays but I don’t have a lot of energy  

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:09,200
so I normally relax and stay at home.
Finally, I normally eat out on Saturdays.  

30
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,920
My favorite type of restaurants are Italian 
restaurants because I love pasta and pizza.  

31
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:25,680
After having dinner, I go to the supermarket or to 
the shopping center because I like to buy the food  

32
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,760
that I will eat during the week.
So, today I have talked to you about what  

33
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:41,520
I normally do every week. Sometimes I do other 
different things, like going to the mountains  

34
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,800
or visiting a new city, but this is 
just a typical week for me. 
 

35
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,560
What are your daily routines? What do you 
normally do at the weekend? Tell me what you  

36
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,240
normally do every week in the comment section 
for me to read. You can find the transcription
