1
00:00:02,848 --> 00:00:04,260
 It’s early morning,

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:07,426
and we are walking on a cobblestone street

3
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:10,505
towards a fairytale like castle.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,994
It seems as though we are walking on a bridge or a raised street

5
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:24,426
which leads right to the entrance of the castle...

6
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:28,009
...right to these closed wooden doors.

7
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:33,643
The medieval castle in front of us

8
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:37,615
is named Eltz Castle (or Burg Eltz).

9
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:41,942
It’s nestled in the hills on the western side of Germany,

10
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,265
in the federal state of Rhineland-Pfalz.

11
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:50,374
means to be located in the hills,

12
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:52,065
near to the hills,

13
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:55,772
almost like the hills are holding the castle gently.

14
00:00:55,772 --> 00:01:00,531
The oldest part of this castle dates to the 9th century.

15
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,538
It expanded as the centuries passed.

16
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:06,782
This picture was taken in the early morning

17
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:11,277
and the castle is surrounded by thick fog,

18
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:15,242
which definitely gives the place a mystical

19
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,885
or even spooky feeling to it.

20
00:01:18,888 --> 00:01:22,827
The hills in the background are covered in dark trees

21
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:26,566
and we can only see the hints of the rising sun

22
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:28,713
starting to light up some clouds.

23
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,345
The castle has many small windows,

24
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:36,086
fairy-tale like spires and turrets,

25
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,214
and pointy A-frame roofs.

26
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:43,653
We can see some flags or banners flying on the top of the castle,

27
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:48,256
held up high into the air by metal spires.

28
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:52,208
These pointy things are called spires.

29
00:01:52,208 --> 00:01:56,029
There is some reconstruction or maintenance going on over here,

30
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:58,244
on the right side of the castle.

31
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:04,544
We can see some scaffolding set up next to the castle walls .

32
00:02:04,544 --> 00:02:06,669
There is a small stone tower

33
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:10,566
peaking out of the fog over here on the right,

34
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:16,863
and the dark forests and fog add to the loneliness one feels in this image.

35
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:19,123
It’s a time of the day to dream

36
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:20,821
and remember the past,

37
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:25,954
long before the tourist crowds come rumbling down this road.

38
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:33,250
The fog almost makes us feel like we are falling out of time… into the past.

39
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,060
It’s possible to visit the castle today.

40
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,985
It is still owned by a branch of the same family

41
00:02:39,985 --> 00:02:42,591
that lived there in the 12th century…

42
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:44,927
thirty-three generations later.

43
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,189
If you are old enough,

44
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:51,626
you may also remember that this castle was on the 500 Detusche mark note,

45
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:54,861
from 1965 to 1992.

46
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:59,719
I wonder how many of those notes one would need to buy this castle…

47
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:03,992
