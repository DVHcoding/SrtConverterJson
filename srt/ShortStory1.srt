1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,710
The first person you think of in the morning

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:07,000
and the last person you think of at night

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,560
Is either the cause of your happiness

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,840
Or the cause of you pain

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,640
Today is not easy

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,140
Tomorrow is more difficult

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,970
But the day after tomorrow will be wonderful

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,160
Don't find someone to make you happy

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,590
Make yourself happy

10
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,630
And then find someone

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,000
You're beautiful

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
You're smart

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,640
You're kind

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,400
You're unique

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,120
You are worthy of love and affection

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,390
The more prepared you are

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,330
The more confidence you will have

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,240
Standing alone doesn't mean I'm alone

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,030
It means I'm strong enough to handle all by myself

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,580
Everyone has his own way of living

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,200
There is no need to copy the lives of others

22
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,700
For the adults

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,200
Something bad always happens in the moment

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,720
When you're tired

25
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,940
You need a person who is warm and lovely

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,270
To comfort you and encourage you

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,070
Life is always like this

28
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,660
we cannot satisfy everyone

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,290
But we still have to go on with passion

30
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,610
Money if not life

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,470
But you need money to live the life you want
