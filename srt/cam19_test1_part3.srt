1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,170
I haven't seen you for a bit, Marie.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,220
No. I've been busy with my project.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,140
You're making a vegan alternative to eggs, aren't you?

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,020
Something that doesn't use animal products?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,840
Yes. I'm using chickpeas.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,020
I had two main aims when I first started looking for an alternative to eggs,

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,320
but actually I've found chickpeas have got more advantages.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,320
But how about your project on reusing waste food?

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,000
You were looking at bread, weren't you?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,100
Yes. It's been hard work, but I've enjoyed it.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:46,200
breaking the stale bread down to a paste then reforming it.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,340
But you were using 3-D printing, weren't you, to make the paste into biscuits?

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,600
Yeah, I'd used that before,

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,220
but in this project, I had time to play around with different patterns for the biscuits

15
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,300
and finding how I could add fruit and vegetables to make them a more appetising colour,

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,260
and I was really pleased with what I managed to produce.

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:17,880
It must've been a great feeling to make something appetising out of bits of old bread that would've been thrown away otherwise.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,360
It was. And I'm hoping that some of the restaurants in town will be interested in the biscuits.

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm going to send them some samples.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,160
I came across something on the internet yesterday that might interest you.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,300
It was a company that's developed touch-sensitive sensors for food labels.

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,460
It's a special sort of label on the food package.

23
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,000
When the label's smooth, the food is fresh

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,060
and then when you can feel bumps on the label,

25
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,760
that means the food's gone bad.

26
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,500
It started off as a project to help visually impaired people know whether food was fit to eat or not.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,240
Interesting.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,280
So just solid food?

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,420
No, things like milk and juice as well.

30
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,960
But actually, I thought it might be really good for drug storage in hospitals and pharmacies.

31
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,260
Right.

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,040
And coming back to food,

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,880
maybe it'd be possible to use it for other things besides freshness.

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,080
Like how many kilograms a joint of meat is, for example.

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,760
Yes, there's all sorts of possibilities.

36
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,760
I was reading an article about food trends predicting how eating habits might change in the next few years.

37
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,260
Oh... things like more focus on local products?

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,560
That seems so obvious, but the shops are still full of imported foods.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
Yes, they need to be more proactive to address that.

40
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,980
And somehow motivate consumers to change, yes.

41
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,760
One thing everyone's aware of is the need for a reduction in unnecessary packaging

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,700
but just about everything you buy in supermarkets is still covered in plastic.

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,040
The government needs to do something about it.

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,140
Absolutely. It's got to change.

45
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:18,120
Do you think there'll be more interest in gluten- and lactose-free food?

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,960
For people with allergies or food intolerances?

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,840
I don't know.

48
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Lots of people I know have been buying that type of food for years now.

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,080
Yes, even if they haven't been diagnosed with an allergy.

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,380
That's right.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:40,480
One thing I've noticed is the number of branded products related to celebrity chefs.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,140
People watch them cooking on TV

53
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,240
and then buy things like spice mixes or frozen foods with the chef's name on...

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,040
I bought something like that once, but I won't again.

55
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,020
Yeah I bought a ready-made spice mix for chicken

56
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,160
which was supposed to be used by a chef I'd seen on television,

57
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,160
and it didn't actually taste of anything.

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,740
Did the article mention 'ghost kitchens' used to produce takeaway food?

59
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,580
No. What are they?

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,380
Well, they might have the name of a restaurant,

61
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,160
but actually they're a cooking facility just for delivery meals.

62
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
The public don't ever go there.

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,940
But people aren't aware of that.

64
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,940
It's all kept very quiet.

65
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,580
So people don't realise the food's not actually from the restaurant?

66
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,980
Right.

67
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,000
Did you know more and more people are using all sorts of different mushrooms now,

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,480
to treat different health concerns?

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,800
Things like heart problems?

70
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,660
Hmm. They might be taking a big risk there.

71
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,120
Yes, it's hard to know which varieties are safe to eat.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,400
Anyway...
