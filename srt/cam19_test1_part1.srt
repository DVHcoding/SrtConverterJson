1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,450
Okay. What would you like to know?

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,000
Well, I'm new to this area,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,170
so perhaps you could tell me something about the park first, please.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,400
Of course.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:19,620
Altogether the park covers 170 acres, that's 69 hectares.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,670
There are three main types of habitat:

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,050
wetland, grassland and woodland.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,600
The woods are well established and varied, with an oak plantation, and other areas of mixed species.

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,700
Right.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,340
The wetland is quite varied, too.

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:43,140
The original farmland was dug up around 40 years ago to extract gravel.

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,920
Once this work was completed,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,780
the gravel pits filled with water, forming the two large lakes.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,620
There are also several smaller ones, ponds and a stream that flows through the park.

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:05,320
Okay, so I suppose with these different habitats there's quite a variety of wildlife.

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,920
There certainly is.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,360
A lot of different species of birds and insects,

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,520
and also animals like deer and rabbits.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,840
And I understand you organise educational visits for school parties.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,140
That's right.

21
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,360
We can organise a wide range of activities and adapt them to suit all ages.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,640
Can you give me some examples of the activities?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,020
Well, one focus is on science,

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,260
where we help children to discover and study plants, trees and insects.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,680
They also collect and analyse data about the things they see.

26
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,040
Another focus is on geography.

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,520
The park is a great environment to learn and practise reading a map

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,140
and using a compass to navigate around the park.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,040
Do you do anything connected with history?

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,640
Yes, we do.

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,040
For instance, the children can explore how the use of the land has changed over time.

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,620
Then there's leisure and tourism.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,700
That focuses on your visitors, I would imagine.

34
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,260
Yes, mostly.

35
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,840
The children find out about them,

36
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,080
their requirements, the problems they may cause and how we manage these.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,120
And another subject we cover is music:

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,920
here the children experiment with natural materials to create sounds

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,620
and explore rhythm and tempo. That must be fun!

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,140
Most children really enjoy it.

41
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,900
And of course, all the activities are educational, too.

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Learning outside the classroom encourages children to be creative,

43
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,740
and to explore and discover for themselves.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,120
I would imagine they get a sense of freedom that might not be a normal part of their lives.

45
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,200
That's right.

46
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,040
And very often the children discover that they can do things they didn't know they could do,

47
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,660
and they develop new skills.

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,720
This gives them greater self-confidence.

49
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,440
It sounds great.

50
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,740
So, what about the practical side of it?

51
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,220
How much does it cost for a full-day visit?

52
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,100
We would expect to bring between 30 and 40 children.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,600
If there are over 30,

54
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,380
it costs Â£4.95 for each child who attends on the day.
