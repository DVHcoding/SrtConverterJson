1
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:19,897
In college sports, American universities
are exploiting, disproportionately,

2
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,230
Black athletes

3
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:22,997
for billions of dollars,

4
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:26,597
while diminishing their education,
health and safety.

5
00:00:27,497 --> 00:00:29,197
Let me start with a bit of history.

6
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,363
In November 1984,

7
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:35,063
an undersized quarterback
from Boston College named Doug Flutie

8
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:38,763
threw a game-winning touchdown pass
against the defending national champions,

9
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:39,997
University of Miami.

10
00:00:40,463 --> 00:00:42,997
As the Hail Mary pass floated
through the fall air

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,530
in front of a packed stadium,

12
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:47,130
millions more watched
with excitement on TV.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,530
After the dramatic win,

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,230
undergraduate application rates
at Boston College shot up by 30 percent,

15
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,697
revealing to universities
the enormous marketing value

16
00:00:57,697 --> 00:00:59,963
of building high-profile sports programs.

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,897
That same year, the United States
Supreme Court heard a case

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,897
in which the Universities
of Georgia and Oklahoma

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,930
challenged rules that limited the number
of football games they could play on TV.

20
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:14,130
Those schools saw the opportunity
to not only make money

21
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:15,830
by televising their games,

22
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:18,530
but to also market
their universities to the world.

23
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:23,097
The Supreme Court agreed that
the broadcasting restrictions were illegal

24
00:01:23,097 --> 00:01:26,630
and schools began to negotiate
TV deals worth millions.

25
00:01:27,363 --> 00:01:31,230
That case opened the floodgates
to money in college athletics,

26
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:33,997
and with it, ever-growing
conflicts of interest

27
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,897
that prioritize sports over education,

28
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,463
promote wins over health and safety

29
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:43,930
and reinforce the disturbing racial
and economic inequities in our country.

30
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,463
Since then, the growth in college sports
has been extraordinary

31
00:01:48,497 --> 00:01:51,797
and schools have earned
record revenues year after year.

32
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,197
The spending during that same time period

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,963
has increased at almost
the same dramatic pace,

34
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:01,930
as universities engage in an arms race
to the top of the rankings.

35
00:02:02,797 --> 00:02:07,630
Massive expenditures on new stadiums,
bigger staffs and record salaries

36
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:09,963
have made it appear,
on the books at least,

37
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,463
that athletic departments
are losing money,

38
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:14,197
while they build lavish facilities

39
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,830
and make multimillionaires
out of coaches and administrators.

40
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:21,797
In fact, in 40 out of 50 states,

41
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,097
the highest-paid public employee is now
a college football or basketball coach.

42
00:02:28,097 --> 00:02:33,397
Meanwhile, college athletes, whose elite
talents generate these massive revenues,

43
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:38,230
are not only denied the ability
to share in the riches they create,

44
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:41,863
too many of them are not given
the education they're promised, either.

45
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:48,663
Today, college athletes are exploited
to the tune of almost 15 billion dollars.

46
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:52,463
That's how much money is generated
by college sports each year.

47
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,663
And I'm all too familiar
with the exploitation,

48
00:02:55,697 --> 00:02:59,030
because I used to be responsible
for enforcing it.

49
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:03,530
Following my own college baseball career
at the University of Dayton,

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,163
I went on to law school
before becoming an investigator

51
00:03:06,197 --> 00:03:08,930
at the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.

52
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:12,097
I traveled to college campuses
across the country

53
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:16,497
and helped enforce a 400-page rule book
that denies athletes the right to get paid

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,730
for their performance

55
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,697
or even profit from their own name.

56
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,663
For instance: unlike the music student
who, in addition to their scholarship,

57
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:27,030
can get paid to record a song,

58
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:30,263
or the English student who,
in addition to their scholarship,

59
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,997
can get paid to write a book,

60
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,863
college athletes cannot
profit from their talents

61
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:36,530
or even take a free meal

62
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,930
without being ruled ineligible
and risking their scholarship.

63
00:03:41,097 --> 00:03:43,163
During my time as an investigator,

64
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:45,663
I questioned hundreds of athletes
and their families

65
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,830
about their financial transactions,

66
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:50,263
dug through their personal
bank and phone records

67
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,597
and scrutinized their relationships
to a humiliating degree,

68
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,697
all for the possibility that someone gave
them something beyond a scholarship,

69
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,197
no matter how petty.

70
00:04:01,163 --> 00:04:04,663
In one case, I questioned
Ohio State football players

71
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:08,697
who received free tattoos and cash
in exchange for memorabilia.

72
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,197
The case received national attention
and became known as "Tattoo Gate,"

73
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,563
as if it were a scandal on par
with political espionage.

74
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,397
The players were suspended
and had to repay the cash

75
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,563
as well as the value of the tattoos.

76
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:28,063
In effect, unpaid athletes were fined
by a billion-dollar organization

77
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:32,330
that gets paid by sponsors to decorate
the athletes in corporate logos.

78
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:37,630
I was told my job was to promote fairness,
but there was nothing fair about that.

79
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:42,497
Shortly thereafter, I left the NCAA
and started fighting for the athletes.

80
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:44,497
It became increasingly clear to me

81
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,763
that rules supposedly designed
to prevent exploitation

82
00:04:47,797 --> 00:04:52,363
instead allow a collection of universities
and their wealthy corporate sponsors

83
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:54,463
to profit off the athletes,

84
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:58,463
who are promised an education
and lured by a chance at the pros

85
00:04:58,497 --> 00:05:00,897
but who too often end up with nothing.

86
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,330
Now, some people believe
college athletes get a free ride.

87
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:09,630
However, there is nothing free
about risking health and safety

88
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,730
while working 40 to 50 hours per week

89
00:05:11,763 --> 00:05:13,863
as you fight to keep your scholarship.

90
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,263
In football alone,

91
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:19,263
there are over 20,000 injuries a year,

92
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:23,363
including 4,000 knee injuries
and 1,000 spinal injuries.

93
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,063
Since 2000, forty players have died.

94
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,830
Beyond football, a recent study revealed

95
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:35,297
that an estimated 60 percent
of Division 1 college athletes

96
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,497
suffer a major injury in their career,

97
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,863
and over half of them
endure chronic conditions

98
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,030
that last well beyond their playing days.

99
00:05:42,497 --> 00:05:44,330
There is nothing free about that,

100
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:48,530
especially as the NCAA refuses to enforce
health and safety standards

101
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,797
and has denied in court
it even has that responsibility.

102
00:05:53,163 --> 00:05:55,430
And about that education
they're promised --

103
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:58,330
according to the College Sports
Research Institute,

104
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:02,297
Black football and basketball players
in the top five conferences

105
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,230
graduate at 22 and 37 percent lower

106
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:07,997
than the undergraduate population.

107
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:13,563
Those who do graduate are often shuffled
into majors with watered-down courses

108
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:17,197
that conform to their athletic schedules
to simply keep them eligible.

109
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,197
The time demands
and required focus on sports

110
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,263
makes it challenging for even
the most well-intentioned athlete

111
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:25,763
to get a meaningful education.

112
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:30,063
This is unacceptable
for a 15 dollar billion industry

113
00:06:30,063 --> 00:06:33,963
run by institutions whose mission
is to educate young people.

114
00:06:35,097 --> 00:06:37,263
Although plenty of athletes succeed,

115
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:40,230
their achievements don't require
rules that deny pay

116
00:06:40,263 --> 00:06:42,797
or a system that limits
educational opportunities

117
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,463
or neglects health and safety.

118
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:46,663
The fact is,

119
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:51,597
American universities oversee a
multibillion-dollar entertainment industry

120
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,897
that denies fundamental rights
to its essential workers,

121
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,863
a disproportionate number
of whom are Black,

122
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:02,530
while making millionaires of largely
white coaches and administrators.

123
00:07:03,197 --> 00:07:08,497
This dynamic has not only deprived many
young people of a meaningful education,

124
00:07:08,497 --> 00:07:13,697
it has shifted generations of wealth
away from mostly Black families

125
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,697
and represents the systemic inequities
plaguing our society.

126
00:07:19,263 --> 00:07:22,297
The good news is that people
are starting to see the truth.

127
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:25,363
The NCAA's own public polling

128
00:07:25,397 --> 00:07:28,597
has revealed that a staggering
79 percent of the public

129
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,697
believe that colleges put money
ahead of their athletes.

130
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:36,097
State and federal lawmakers,
both Republican and Democrat,

131
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,797
have also taken notice and started to act.

132
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:43,597
Several US senators have rightly
described the problems in college sports

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,197
as a civil rights issue.

134
00:07:46,263 --> 00:07:49,063
Meanwhile, college athletes
from across the country

135
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:53,697
have started to stand up to demand
greater health and safety protections,

136
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,197
representation rights,

137
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,263
attention to racial
and social justice issues

138
00:07:58,297 --> 00:07:59,963
and economic fairness.

139
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:03,297
Those who think the players
should just stick to sports

140
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,130
fail to recognize how rarely
college athletes speak up

141
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,930
and ignore the great
personal risk they take

142
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:11,963
in confronting a powerful industry,

143
00:08:11,997 --> 00:08:14,063
especially without any representation.

144
00:08:14,863 --> 00:08:17,130
More importantly,
critics fail to acknowledge

145
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,730
that college athletes
are simply seeking rights

146
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:22,830
that are afforded to virtually
everyone else in this country

147
00:08:22,863 --> 00:08:25,697
and basic protections that
shouldn't even be in question.

148
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:30,897
I agree that college sports should
be an enjoyable distraction,

149
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,397
but not when they're distracting us
from the very injustice they enable.

150
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,063
In his retirement,

151
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:41,797
the NCAA's first and longest-serving
executive director, Walter Byers,

152
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:45,130
described college sports as

153
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:50,730
"the plantation mentality resurrected
and blessed by today's campus executives."

154
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,830
This is a telling quote from the man
who designed this system

155
00:08:54,863 --> 00:08:57,030
and the one who knew it best.

156
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,030
But you don't have to be an insider

157
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,530
to recognize the exploitation
of young people.

158
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:04,663
You don't have to be
a Republican or a Democrat

159
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:08,797
to be troubled by the irresponsible
spending or the disregard for values

160
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,497
at our universities.

161
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,630
You don't even have to be a sports fan.

162
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:16,297
You just have to believe
in basic ideas of fairness

163
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,530
and the values of higher education.

164
00:09:20,463 --> 00:09:22,730
So let's require that all college athletes

165
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,263
are given a chance
at a meaningful education.

166
00:09:26,663 --> 00:09:30,197
Let's demand responsible spending
by our universities

167
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,463
and fairly allocate the billions
of dollars being generated.

168
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,563
Let's create robust
health and safety standards

169
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:39,863
to protect those
who entertain us with their bodies

170
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:41,597
and enforce those standards.

171
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,363
Let's provide college athletes
with a representative body

172
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,963
so they have recourse
when things go wrong

173
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:50,097
and a voice about how
to make things right.

174
00:09:50,897 --> 00:09:54,030
Finally, let's rise
to the challenge of our time

175
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:55,997
and once and for all correct

176
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,630
the persistent racial
and economic inequities

177
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:02,230
that apply to college sports and beyond.

178
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,930
Change is long overdue,

179
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,030
but there has never been
a better time than now.
