00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
This is the real english conversations podcast

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:11,800
Where you'll find the advice you need to be able to confidently use your English in the real world.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,528
Hi everybody, this is Amy from Real English Conversations and I'm here with Curtis.

4
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:23,264
Hi everybody!

5
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:29,488
And today, we are going to tell you all
about how you can predict your future or tell fortunes

6
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:33,712
So there's four main or common ways 

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,840
that people tell fortunes in American culture. What are they? 

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:44,010
They are palm reading, tarot cards, tea leaves and astrology.

9
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,272
Alright. And there are some less known ways which I found today when I was on Wikipedia
They are palm reading, tarot cards, tea leaves and astrology.

10
00:00:44,272 --> 00:00:51,440
Alright. And there are some less known ways which I found today when I was on Wikipedia

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,000
learning a little bit about fortune telling. And I thought that I would talk about them.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,048
So, the first one is roosters pecking grain which I imagine is just a plate 
learning a little bit about fortune telling. And I thought that I would talk about them.

13
00:00:56,048 --> 00:01:04,528
So, the first one is roosters pecking grain which I imagine is just a plate 

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,600
maybe in front of the rooster and he eats his food and then after there is a pattern and it is interpreted somehow.

15
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:19,000
And another one, a little bit more gruesome, is reading the livers of sacrificed animals.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,040
Oooh, yeah. That sounds like something from the medieval days.
And another one, a little bit more gruesome, is reading the livers of sacrificed animals.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,152
Oooh, yeah. That sounds like something from the medieval days.

18
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:30,960
Yeah, definitely. And the last one which is the most disgusting of all, is reading animal poop.

19
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:32,272
Eeew.

20
00:01:32,352 --> 00:01:38,770
I don't know whose animal poop they are reading or how you become an expert in that,

21
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:38,800
but it’s definitely not a profession that I want.
I don't know whose animal poop they are reading or how you become an expert in that,

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,720
but it’s definitely not a profession that I want.

23
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Sounds gross.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,620
So why don’t you tell us a little bit
about palm reading?

25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:45,808
Okay, palm reading is a way of telling your future or your past depending on
So why don’t you tell us a little bit
about palm reading?

26
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:53,776
Okay, palm reading is a way of telling your future or your past depending on

27
00:01:53,810 --> 00:02:01,689
the lines and designs in the palm of your hand.
And there's many of them. There's a life line,

28
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:08,288
a love line, so many of them I can't remember
all of them but yeah, based on the length

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,176
or the size or the shape of these patterns 

30
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:18,112
that would explain what has happened in your past or what could be happening in your future.

31
00:02:18,656 --> 00:02:25,792
And the next one is tarot cards. So with
tarot card reading, what happens is, 

32
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:32,944
if you are having your fortune being told, you have
the deck of cards and you shuffle them 

33
00:02:32,976 --> 00:02:40,112
and mix them up a bit and then you put the deck
together, cut the deck at whatever point you want

34
00:02:40,224 --> 00:02:44,870
which is just separating the deck into
two and then you hand it to the person

35
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:44,896
Who is reading your cards. They lay out the cards
in some sort of order and they are based on
which is just separating the deck into
two and then you hand it to the person

36
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:53,949
Who is reading your cards. They lay out the cards
in some sort of order and they are based on

37
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,408
the symbols or the characters that are on these cards. 

38
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,090
They are going to determine your future or your fortune.

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,384
Based on the different images.
They are going to determine your future or your fortune.

40
00:03:02,384 --> 00:03:03,792
Based on the different images.

41
00:03:03,888 --> 00:03:09,664
That's right and I think the next one
is really good for Curtis to explain  

42
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,900
Because it is about tea leaf reading. And this is
something that I can remember his mom doing

43
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:16,960
during special occasions like Christmas or
Thanksgiving after dinner when we were drinking tea.
Because it is about tea leaf reading. And this is
something that I can remember his mom doing

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:24,032
during special occasions like Christmas or
Thanksgiving after dinner when we were drinking tea.

45
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:26,240
So how does it go?

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,520
Well it is a special way of preparing tea. 

47
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:34,120
Obviously it’s loose leaf tea. So it’s not from a tea bag.

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,576
The tea leaves are floating around in the pot. 
Obviously it’s loose leaf tea. So it’s not from a tea bag.

49
00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:37,904
The tea leaves are floating around in the pot. 

50
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,470
Because you want to make sure that they can get into the cup, right?

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,576
Right. So when it is poured, 
Because you want to make sure that they can get into the cup, right?

52
00:03:40,576 --> 00:03:42,640
Right. So when it is poured, 

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,430
the leaf will or the leaves will fall into the cup and you normally leave

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,976
a bit of tea in the bottom of your cup and
swirl it around and then you turn it over

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,648
and after you turn it over, you turn it three
times in a certain direction.

56
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,232
Like on the saucer.

57
00:04:05,744 --> 00:04:09,990
Turning it with the cup upside down,
going one, two, three for turns.

58
00:04:10,432 --> 00:04:14,910
And then you turn back the cup up
back over again so it's right side up.

59
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,810
And then our famous tea leaf reader,
Marilyn...

60
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,358
she even had a book.

61
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,816
Yeah, to be able to identify the different shapes

62
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:33,880
and she knew... I can't remember what it was but I think if it's close to the rim
of the cup, it was happening sooner.

63
00:04:34,496 --> 00:04:39,824
Or if it was close to the handle of
the cup. Yeah you look into the cup 

64
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:47,024
and you will see different patterns and you know, like, I think she saw a rooster or tree or something

65
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,256
Yeah, your future or things, once
again that have happened in your past 

66
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:56,624
are revealed through those patterns.

67
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:59,728
I think the patterns are for the future though.

68
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:01,472
We are talking about

69
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:05,328
No All of them we are talking about predicting
your future, not the past.

70
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,960
True, True

71
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,800
So anyway, that's about tea leaf reading.

72
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:13,248
Right.

73
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,536
And what is astrology about?

74
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:25,888
Okay. Astrology is about different
signs that are based on the planets 

75
00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:30,810
and the stars, the sun, the moon and your birthday as well.

76
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,776
Alright and depending on your birthday particularly. 

77
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,048
There's something that you'll see, it's like a horoscope.

78
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:43,616
And they are published often in newspapers. 

79
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:47,344
And depending on what your zodiac sign is, 

80
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:52,224
you have a horoscope which is a prediction on how your day is gonna go.

81
00:05:52,256 --> 00:05:55,104
Right. So what are the twelve zodiac signs?

82
00:05:55,216 --> 00:06:02,032
There are twelve zodiac signs and they are: Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus,

83
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:10,960
Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius and Capricorn.

84
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:12,656
And which sign are you?

85
00:06:12,736 --> 00:06:18,528
I am a Virgo. But I am on what is called the cusp. 

86
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:23,344
So my birthday falls on the last day of Virgo 

87
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:29,072
but the next day of Libra is the day after my birthday. 

88
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,720
So sometimes, Curtis’s horoscope is
more accurate for Libra, 

89
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:38,528
And sometimes it's more accurate to Virgo. 

90
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,720
Because you could
imagine if you were born on September 22nd at 11PM at night.

91
00:06:44,832 --> 00:06:50,112
You are only one hour away
from the next zodiac sign which is Libra.

92
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:56,848
So, in theory you should have personality
tendencies or your luck, 

93
00:06:56,864 --> 00:07:02,544
if you pay attention to these things and believe it, would be more
of a Libra influence.

94
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:04,720
And you are a Gemini.

95
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:10,464
I am a Gemini which is supposed to be
the dual personality so I don't know. 

96
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,112
I think I'm really, really nice most of the time but
I can definitely be mean and evil from time to time

97
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:17,120
Really?

98
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:20,640
Curtis pretends he never sees it. 

99
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,288
Anyway, how about you read our forecast or our horoscope for today?

100
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:37,184
Okay, I'm going to start with yours.
And yours is, let me just bring this up. Here we go

101
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:42,256
Brainstorming with other people could
lead to incredible solutions. 

102
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,800
And if you are a Gemini who is a business person, that requires
a lot of creative energy, it will blossom today.

103
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,376
That sounds like a good day for me to 

104
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,448
do some business work and hopefully be successful 

105
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,240
and talk to some people. And what is your horoscope?

106
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:01,552
Mine for today?

107
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:03,184
Is this Virgo or Libra?

108
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,480
This is Virgo.

109
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,304
Okay, so your real horoscope.

110
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:14,880
An intense emotional dream could move you so powerfully 

111
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:22,496
that you wake with the odd sense
that the dream was rea l. Write it down, Virgo!

112
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:29,552
Efforts to overcome obstacles and advance
yourself in your career could finally be paying off

113
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,496
Wow. That's actually interesting because in that list of ways of predicting the future,

114
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:39,904
there was one that was based on dreams. 

115
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:45,664
So maybe you should write down whatever your dream was last night and then we should find a dream reader 

116
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:48,010
and then we'll know even more about your future.

117
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,024
That's exciting.

118
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:54,224
Yeah. So, astrology I actually had a
period of time where I was really interested

119
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:59,152
in astrology and I had this book which was, 

120
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:04,384
I think it was called, "The Only Astrology Book You'll Ever Need" 

121
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,216
and it was pretty thorough.
It's like a textbook with 300 pages or something.

122
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,400
it was huge, I remember. It was a really, big book.

123
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:17,680
And it factored all the aspects
of astrology 

124
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,880
down to the time that you were born. 

125
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,272
So if you were born at 11 o'clock on
this day, and this year,

126
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:30,608
 I guess the sun was in this position and the moon was in that position, 

127
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,992
and some planet was flying around the universe

128
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:38,464
It had different influences on you. 

129
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:42,224
And after you had calculated everything, 

130
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:44,512
you read a couple of different pages, 
And after you had calculated everything, 

131
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,936
and it described in detail about your character,
And after you had calculated everything, 

132
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:50,050
And after you had calculated everything, 

133
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,064
your personality, your tendencies, the habits
that you have, 

134
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:57,184
the things that you like or you don't like. 

135
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,296
Really in a lot of detail.
And the first time that I seen this book was actually a friend of mine

136
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:06,352
and I was blown away with it's accuracy.

137
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:09,312
 I thought it was probably 90% accurate 

138
00:10:10,064 --> 00:10:12,976
but not vague like these horoscopes. 

139
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,136
These could be applicable for anybody. 

140
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,400
Like you could have a powerful brainstorming day.

141
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,120
I could.

142
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,136
And I could have had a strange dream.
I could.

143
00:10:19,136 --> 00:10:22,624
And I could have had a strange dream.

144
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:23,104
Right.

145
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:24,200
That I should write down.

146
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:30,200
But this book that you are talking about, it was more accurate. It was like almost like you wrote about it.

147
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:35,712
Yeah, wrote about myself and if you were to I gave my horoscope 

148
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,160
to you and said, this is yours, and just change the title at the top, 

149
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,312
you'd be like, "Well, this isn't like me at all." 

150
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,696
But his was really, really accurate as well. 

151
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,560
Especially because he was on the cusp.

152
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:54,384
It was more of a proper horoscope 

153
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,104
instead of the blend or having to read one and then read the other one

154
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:01,952
because it was down to the day.

155
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,128
It was very accurate. 

156
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,904
So that's where my opinion changed a little bit about astrology. 

157
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,576
I don't think that I would be willing to base my life decisions on it.

158
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:14,496
You weren’t skeptical.
