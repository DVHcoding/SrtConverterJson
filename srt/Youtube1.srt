1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,037
Good evening my friends.

2
00:00:02,037 --> 00:00:08,124
So you want to learn to speak and understand English.

3
00:00:08,124 --> 00:00:11,128
You have had a long day.

4
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:13,564
You are tired.

5
00:00:13,564 --> 00:00:18,281
Lay down in your bed… close your heavy eyes…

6
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,129
and let’s listen to a story

7
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:27,125
while we slowly fall into the arms of the English language.

8
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,855
Once… many years ago…

9
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:35,233
there was a traveler who wanted to learn English.

10
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:39,327
This traveler wanted to explore the world.

11
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:43,946
He wanted to communicate with people who were different than him.

12
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:51,484
As a child, he listened to stories about wonderful places in other lands.

13
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:58,950
He heard about people that wore different clothes and ate different types of food.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,090
He dreamed of visiting those far away places.

15
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,986
But as an adult, he could only speak his local language.

16
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,545
His language was beautiful.

17
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:14,732
In many ways, it was magical.

18
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:17,782
It reminded him of his grandparents

19
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:21,396
and of eating long meals with his family,

20
00:01:21,396 --> 00:01:24,846
but the only people who could speak this language

21
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:29,772
lived in the small village where the traveler had grown up.

22
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:31,802
The traveler worked hard

23
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:36,785
and with time, saved enough money to buy some grammar books

24
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:38,964
about the English language.

25
00:01:38,964 --> 00:01:42,778
He knew that English was spoken by many people.

26
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:50,672
This language was spoken by unknown faces in those far away places.

27
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:54,685
This language could help him speak to those people

28
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:58,883
with different cultures and different points of view.

29
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:04,272
This language was the key to opening up the world.

30
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:09,128
So the traveler open those grammar books about English

31
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:12,549
and tried to understand what he read.

32
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,332
He studied.

33
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:17,702
He studied as much as he could,

34
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:21,790
but he often found his mind wandering.

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:28,857
He would fall asleep with the books in his hands and begin to dream.

36
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:33,003
Dream of those far away places.

37
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:36,514
He didn’t learn much from those books.

38
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:40,570
One day, a young woman visited his village.

39
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:46,407
Her eyes were a light copper brown that enchanted him.

40
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:53,949
She spoke his language with a strange but enchanting accent from an unknown place.

41
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:56,444
Her language was not perfect,

42
00:02:56,444 --> 00:03:00,796
but she could easily communicate with the villagers.

43
00:03:00,796 --> 00:03:03,894
After watching her for a long time,

44
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:08,041
the traveler walked up to this vistor and asked,

45
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:12,214
“Excuse me…where did you learn our language?

46
00:03:12,214 --> 00:03:18,257
I want to learn English so I can travel. I want to visit far away places.

47
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,578
I want to communicate with the world.

48
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:21,750
Can you help me?”

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:26,745
She looked at him with a soft and understanding smile.

50
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,752
“Let me give you some advice.

51
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:34,829
You should walk east for three or fours days until you find a deep lake.

52
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,982
There is a village by this lake.

53
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:41,030
Walk there and speak to the people you find there.

54
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,696
Ask them about an old man with a white beard

55
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:47,561
who sits on a large stone by the lake.

56
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,573
They will know who I am speaking about.”

57
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:57,438
She stepped closer to him, and moved her lips near to his right ear and whispered,

58
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:03,600
“He will tell you the secret of learning English”.

59
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,216
She stepped away from the traveler and winked at him with a cat like smile,

60
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,952
before she moved away.

61
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:13,039
Her perfume was in the air,

62
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,312
and the traveler knew that he would follow her advice.

63
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:20,974
The next day he said goodbye to his friends and family,

64
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,361
telling them he would be home in about a week.

65
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:27,568
He left his village and headed east.

66
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,082
He moved through the tall grass

67
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:33,784
and felt the wind blowing against his face.

68
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:37,313
He listened to the insects around him as he moved

69
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:45,204
and tried to understand the birdsongs as he passed into an area he had never visited before.

70
00:04:46,644 --> 00:04:51,056
After a few days he arrived at the lake the woman had mentioned.

71
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:55,149
A small collection of houses were spread throughout the forest

72
00:04:55,149 --> 00:05:00,637
and the people there spoke a language that was slightly different than his.

73
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:03,314
It was difficult to understand the people,

74
00:05:03,314 --> 00:05:07,939
but after some time listening to them and trying to communicate,

75
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:10,589
the traveler eventually was told

76
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:14,477
where he could find the old man with a white beard.

77
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:18,337
He hiked through the light forest to the opposite side of the lake

78
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:21,285
and found the old man sitting there,

79
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:25,721
with leather like skin, leaning back on a rock.

80
00:05:25,721 --> 00:05:28,237
His eyes were closed. 

81
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:32,192
“Excuse me sir… I come from a village not far from here.

82
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:33,512
I have heard of you.

83
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:36,831
Can you tell me the secret of learning English?”

84
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:40,240
The old man slowly opened his eyes,

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,654
like a turtle waking up from a long nap.

86
00:05:43,654 --> 00:05:48,091
The man said, “The secret of how to learn English?

87
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:52,010
Strange you would ask an old man in the forest,

88
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,288
but yes… I know of what you speak.

89
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,765
To learn English, you must use it.

90
00:05:58,765 --> 00:06:01,117
You must speak it.

91
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:02,758
You must read it.

92
00:06:02,758 --> 00:06:05,384
You must listen to it.

93
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:09,775
You must learn to love this language so much,

94
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:14,634
that you will spend every free moment thinking about it.

95
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:19,644
You must find your motivation traveler, or you will learn nothing.

96
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:24,817
You will waste your time measuring yourself against what someone else created,

97
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:29,759
or you will give your money to those who promise you a quick answer.

98
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,850
Some will even suggest you listen to the language in your sleep,

99
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,835
hoping it will fall into your dreams,

100
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:43,710
promising you that you will wake up speaking fluently.

101
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,626
You will do these things and may even believe them

102
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:51,394
not because you are lazy or ignorant. No...

103
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:56,665
You will believe them because learning a language is hard.

104
00:06:56,665 --> 00:07:02,232
It is one of the most difficult things that a human could try to learn.

105
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:06,247
It is a long road to learning a language my friend,

106
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:10,193
and there are no shortcuts that work for everyone.

107
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:13,500
You must find your own way.

108
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,956
But do not despair.

109
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:18,215
Do not worry.

110
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,950
Do not be overwhelmed by frustration.

111
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,342
The language will come to you,

112
00:07:24,342 --> 00:07:27,305
when you have found your motivation,

113
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:31,338
or your motivation has found you.

114
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,144
The traveler listened.

115
00:07:34,144 --> 00:07:36,995
The traveler thought silently.

116
00:07:36,995 --> 00:07:39,149
The traveler then answered,

117
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,235
“But I don’t know where to start.

118
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:44,217
I am not in love with the English language.

119
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:46,384
I simply want to travel

120
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,843
Traveling is what my heart desires.

121
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,796
Not English grammar.

122
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:55,449
The old man looked at the trees in the forest around them.

123
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:02,292
He turned to look at the calm waves on the lake behind him, breathing calmly.

124
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,935
He turned back to the traveler, and told him,

125
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:10,440
“Then you should continue down this trail here in the forest.

126
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,921
It will take you through the deep woods.

127
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:15,777
Continue walking throughout the night,

128
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:18,329
do not stop and do not sleep.

129
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:25,506
By morning, you will come to a village with new smells and with people who look different than you or I.

130
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,400
Explore this village.

131
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,376
In this village, you can find a person or two who speaks English.

132
00:08:32,376 --> 00:08:34,723
Learn a few words from each of them.

133
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:39,044
The old man took out a pencil and a brown piece of paper.

134
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,658
He wrote on the paper slowly,

135
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,592
scribbling a long message out word by word.

136
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:51,719
His white beard and white eyebrows moving up and down as he smiled to himself.

137
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,744
He held the paper out to the traveler.

138
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:56,916
“While you are walking this evening,

139
00:08:56,916 --> 00:09:00,697
I ask you to repeat these words to yourself.

140
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:02,767
Speak them in your mind,

141
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:05,981
or speak them to the trees.

142
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,283
Speak them as you travel.

143
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:12,123
Now go my friend, the world lies in front of you.

144
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:14,407
You can listen to me or not..

145
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:19,319
after all, I am just an old man sitting on a rock”.

146
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,115
With that, the old man closed his eyes.

147
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:26,970
The traveler took the paper and looked at the trail.

148
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,525
He could go home, but he was bored with home.

149
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:32,232
He had little to lose.

150
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:36,153
This new village through the deep woods was only a day away.

151
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:39,335
He began to walk down the trail.

152
00:09:39,335 --> 00:09:41,782
The wind blew through the leaves

153
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:47,097
and after a few minutes he looked at what the old man had written on the paper.

154
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:50,483
He followed the old man’s instructions,

155
00:09:50,483 --> 00:09:53,266
and read the message out loud.

156
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,848
The secret to learning a language.

157
00:09:55,848 --> 00:10:00,419
The traveler laughed, but he read the message anyways.

158
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:04,128
“To learn a language, one must use it.

159
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:08,684
To learn to speak a language, one must speak it.

160
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:14,072
To learn to understand a language, one must listen to it.

161
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:19,332
To learn to live a language, one must live it.

162
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:23,867
To learn to communicate, one must communicate.

163
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:29,171
I must find my motivation, or I will learn nothing.

164
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:33,149
Others will promise me fast answers.

165
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,187
Others will give me false hopes.

166
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:40,122
Others will profit from my worries.

167
00:10:40,122 --> 00:10:44,563
Others will tell me that I can learn a language while I sleep,

168
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:48,464
if only someone would speak to me all night.

169
00:10:48,464 --> 00:10:52,542
This is not true, but I may believe it to be so.

170
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:57,277
I will not believe it because I am lazy or ignorant,

171
00:10:57,277 --> 00:11:03,788
but because I have not accepted that learning a language is hard.

172
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:08,707
It is one of the most difficult things that a human can do.

173
00:11:08,707 --> 00:11:12,784
It is an endless journey along a long road,

174
00:11:12,784 --> 00:11:17,059
but it is rewarding journey and a beautiful road,

175
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:20,027
and it will open up the world to me.

176
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:25,683
It will help lead me to what and who I am searching for.

177
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:27,014
Do not despair.

178
00:11:27,014 --> 00:11:29,399
Do not worry.

179
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,728
You are intelligent.

180
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:34,042
You are smart.

181
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:38,913
You have simply not had the opportunity to shine.

182
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:44,509
You will learn the English language, when you find your true motivation.”

183
00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:49,157
The traveler continued walking… and he repeated the words….

184
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,828
He sat down with his back against a rock and closed his eyes.

185
00:11:58,828 --> 00:12:05,354
He might need a small rest, but he was sure he would continue on.

186
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:11,183
He had been thinking about the old man’s words for more than an hour.

187
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:15,929
The traveler’s motivation for learning English was clear.

188
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:18,911
Exploring. Traveling.

189
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:24,389
He’d focus on that while he picked up pieces of language on the way.

190
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:30,536
He would stop worrying about being perfect.

191
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:34,892
In the future, his motivation might change.

192
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:38,645
Perhaps it would be in getting a new job.

193
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:45,265
Most likely, it would come from wanting to communicate with interesting people.

194
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:50,725
For the moment, for him, it was traveling.

195
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:56,306
He would no longer stress about prepositions and grammar books,

196
00:12:56,306 --> 00:13:01,964
but he would focus on the new places he wanted to visit.

197
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:06,746
He’d learn English on the way, as he needed to.

198
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:12,289
The fun would be in the journey, not the destination.

199
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:19,081
He took a long breath and fell into a deep sleep, smiling.

200
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:23,966
He would start exercising his English when he woke up.

201
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:29,744
When he arrived at the village, he would search out people to speak with.

202
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:34,970
While he slept, he would let his brain... rest....
